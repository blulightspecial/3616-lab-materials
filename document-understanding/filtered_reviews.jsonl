{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Pretty Good Despite Some Small Complaints.", "text": "I received this washer today and ran it for the first time as soon as I unpacked it. It does what it's supposed to do. The agitation is powerful, surprisingly powerful. The spin dryer does an amazing job and is pretty quiet once the spinner gets going. I was not about to haul this thing atop some makeshift platform in order to make the gravity drain work, and I certainly wasn't going to carry pots of drain water to dump into the sink - I simply kept the drain hose in an upright position attaching it to the provided clip on the side of the washer and then slipped a smaller hose down inside the main drain hose - the other end of the smaller hose is attached to a small little pump I bought at my local home improvement store and drains into the kitchen sink. To drain the water I simply switched the washer to the 'Drain' setting and flipped the switch on the pump. Easy as pie. I did the same when running the spin dryer.<br />I do have a couple of complaints....<br />1. The washer arrived very, very dirty, especially the bottom - there was gross brown crud all over the bottom.<br />2. There was a number scratches and deep gouges on the outside.<br />3. The provided hose to fill is worthless - I simply attached a small hose used for normal full sized washing machines to my kitchen sink spigot and filled the washer that way - super easy and fast.<br /><br />It definitely cannot handle adult sized bedding, and I have my doubts that it can handle even one pair of jeans - not because of power, because it's pretty powerful, but I say this due to it's size - it's crazy small inside.

It cleans my clothes better than anything. I use an oxy laundry detergent but just a dab because you don't want anything too sudsy. I usually use cold to temperate water unless it's socks and undies then I let them wash, sit for 5 mins and wash again. Sparkling white. The washing cycle agitates wonderfully and the spin cycle almost completely dries the clothes. They're barely damp. I turn on my fan and they are dry in a half an hour. I have to put the machine up on a small table that's about the same height as my bathtub because there's no pump to get the water out of the machine, it drains via gravity. I thought about buying a small pool pump but for now it's fine. I've saved 30 dollars a week not going to the laundromat anymore and it's convenient and easy to use. I let it dry after I'm done (keeping the lids open) and I spray it with lysol because I don't want mold to grow on it. Also, keep the lint filter clean after every wash before you rinse so you don't get the fuzz on the clothes in the rinse cycle.  I use my long hose hand held shower head to fill it but it has leads for a small hose. My sink would work but it doesn't come apart to attach a hose.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Perfect for an RV when a laundromat isn't available", "text": "I've seen some YouTube reviews on this and similar items. I live in an RV full time without a laundromat near by. So I purchased this to wash my clothes.<br /><br />The washer is a little noisy but if I shut my bathroom door, I don't hear it as much. When I first got it the back wasn't properly snapped into place but that was easily fixed.  The hose provided to fill the washer is useless, I just put my shower head into the tub.<br /><br />When I use this, I put about a tablespoon to 1.5 tablespoons of liquid laundry detergent for a large load with about half a scoop of oxi clean. I run my machine for 15 mins and then let it sit. I will drain the dirty water and rinse the tub a little bit. Then close the drain and fill with clean water and run for 15 more minutes. Then I will drain again. Pull half if the clothes and spin them for at max 4 mins. After the spin, they are damp but quickly dry.<br /><br />There are water levels for low, middle, and high water marks on the lint filter but they are hard to see. The lint filter is a nice way to catch loose thread but it doesn't filter all of the water.<br /><br />I store it behind my entertainment center and it fits really well there. The issue is getting into my bathroom. I have to go up a small set of stairs to the bathroom and it's a little bulky to easily get up there.  Because it has legs, I can have it in my shower when it's draining and not have to worry about the motor getting wet.<br /><br />Overall, it's a nice machine. I can put 2 pairs of jeans and several shirts in a load.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Giantex -  Practical Innovations for people who are not afraid to do a little extra work", "text": "This was a life saver for me.  After our washer stopped working and then our dryer, again, I was just so done.  I decided I needed a backup as going to the laundromat is a huge problem for me time wise.  My schedule is just way too hectic for that.  So after trying hand washing alone and messing up my hands in the process (hello joint pain), I needed another option.  This little gem did just that for me.  No, you cannot wash a lot of stuff in here.  I usually am able to fit in about 3-5 shirts, 2 pants (depending on the type).  I can even fit sheets in there, at least 2-3 twin size and 3-4 pillowcase covers, no blankets obviously.  Nevertheless, it seriously does the job.  My clothes do come out much cleaner and I also noticed that when washing my clothes in this little bit of practical magic that my skin did not itch as opposed to when we use a traditional washer.  Furthermore, the little spinner also does a pretty good job in that when I hang my clothes up to air dry they are done usually within an hour or two.  However, I do not do a lot of loads in one day as I do wring out any excess water before adding to the spinner and that can further take a toll on my hands so I just wash at best 2-3 loads a day with this.  Now I no longer keep a hamper in my bathroom I just put my things in there until I have enough for a load.<br />I have set up a little laundry station in my bathroom.  This little baby does not take up much space.  I place it in the bathtub when using and add water directly from the faucet from the tub by simply tilting it directly underneath.  When the load is done I switch to drain and lift one side, let the hose hang down to drain the water and repeat until the water is out (usually takes me 2 times to completely drain).  I know this sounds more cumbersome but its not a strain for me.  When I'm done using I put it back in its place after its been thoroughly drained.  FYI:  I tend to let it sit in the tub for a little while after basically manually draining to make sure all of the water is out to prevent leaks which have not happened.  It's not really heavy at all at 20lbs when empty and close to 50lb+ when fully loaded.  But, I like it and I no longer have to worry if my machines conk out again.<br />As for the company, the product came in good time with excellent packaging.  Really pleased with this purchase.

For the first day, I used bowls to fill the machine which was a lot of work but did the job. The next day, I bought a funnel big enough to cover my shower head, drilled two holes on opposite sides at the top, and used a small bungie cord to put a hook into each hole and then hang it over the shower head. I then cut two slits into the hose to allow the funnel to fit inside the faucet end, then duct taped it to seal. I attached the hose to the machine and it worked perfectly. My shower is low flow so I could turn it on full. I put the machine in the shower and ran it from there with no issues, other than to hold the machine when the spinner starts up because the vibration is very strong. My overall reaction is that it does a good job cleaning and the spinner is very good. Similar to a spa's machine to dry your bathing suit. It is labor intensive because you must move the clothes a few at a time to the spinner and you can only put a few things in at a time, but my clothes dry beautifully on a rack and the towels only need 15 minutes in a dryer at the laundromat until I can string up a clothesline in the summer.

More like, things to be aware of and how to work around them:<br />> I can't stress enough, this is not a full-sized machine. You can't work it like a traditional large, sturdy, metal washer. It makes a light burning plastic smell with larger loads, & I've never filled it higher than about halfway between the Med and High fill lines out of fear of over-stressing the motor. Not made to do all your weekly laundry in one day (unless it's a single person's maybe), but more like 2, 3 loads max a day...meaning multiple laundry days a week may be needed. This is in order to preserve the life of your machine becaaauuusseee...<br />> The only -actual- con: this company seems unresponsive with inquiries about replacements/repairs, as other reviewers have noted.<br /><br />> Must elevate to drain properly. If the drain hose makes the water travel against gravity at any point (i.e. UP), it won't drain all the way. I've remedied this by putting it on a storage tub to drain ~90% and then lifting it a couple inches to completely drain the rest.<br /><br />> No heated dryer. Spin dryer does get clothes about 90~95% dry though, much dryer than just-out-of-the-wash. I was in disbelief when I first used it, ha. To prevent stiff clothes, add a bit of white vinegar to your washer run. It's a little stiffer than your usual heated dryer, but not like you paid for starch at the dry cleaners. It hasn't bothered me at all.<br /><br />> How...do I...fill it? It does come with a hose but that probably won't fit your sink. I use the shower-head from my bath tub and fill it directly. Others fill buckets and then pour in the water from there. Others have bought adapters for -make- the hose fit their sink. Others utilize the dustpan sink funnel technique<br /><br />> It's super noisy/wobbly/chaotic! = It's probably overloaded. Aside from the first and last ~7 seconds of the spin dryer, it shouldn't be moving much at all. Neither tub should be filled to the top; your clothes need room to move!", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AFTXWCSZDYK6RN76OYUO5SYUMUCA", "timestamp": 1548113520356, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": true}

The washer has rough edges along one side that would simply just damage the clothes while washing. You would have to drain and refill the water multiple times in order to rinse the clothes well. As another reviewer had accurately stated, it is literally just a step above hand washing. Be cautious of water dripping along the tube as well. As for the dryer, it is poorly designed. It uses a spinning effect vs. heat. On the contrary, it is more rough in drying clothes than a standard dryer. It also lacks a way to filter all of the lint. The new towels and clothes laundered came out looking like they were old and worn/torn and had to be disposed of.

I used it heavily for a month while waiting for service on my large he machine..Using this is very satisfying even if it requires more intervention from the user.  I have it set up in my bathroom on a bamboo coffee table(see another review).  It has no pump so it must be manually filled and drained, but this is easy with the tub connections and drain. It is much like using an old wringer machine, except that it has a separate spinner to do the wringing.  I love having total control over the amount of water and agitation time, the number of rinses and the length of spin time.  It has turned out to be an awesome way to wash my soft slippers and fabric shoes.  I can control the quality of the wash and rinse entirely.  The only caveat is being careful with the spinner, which is nothing more than a terrific centrifuge.  Balance your spin load symmetrically, especially slippers, and watch it until it achieves maximum spin( about 20 seconds).  If there is a load distribution problem it will sound wrong.  Stop it and rearrange your items.  This does not happen often. I know it paid for itself may times over while my big machine was broken.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Okay for what it is, but not great.  And will be amazed if it lasts.", "text": "This washing machine isn't terrible.  The spinner works great, and the washing portion is okay.  I bought it and a Magic Chef dryer to save me the 1.5 hour round trip to the laundromat.<br /><br />I think it is worth what I paid, but it comes at a price.  The obvious one - and it works fine for me in my tiny house - is that a full load is now about 1/3rd of a load.  So laundry does take longer; more than 1.5 hours longer.  Somewhere there is a small leak that I hope doesn't get worse.  Perhaps the hose attachment?  I have to track it down.<br /><br />And speaking of the hose, the first time I drained the tub, I had a challenge getting my container low enough to siphon off the water.  So those that put the machine up on a sturdy stand know what they are talking about.  An odd quirk occurred after that first use of the drain.  The tub will continue to drain until and unless you elevate or clamp the drain hose.  I suspect some kind of stuck valve or shutter.<br /><br />As I said, the spinner (though very small) works great and only takes a minute or so to get the rinsed garment (one or two at a time ONLY) ready for the dryer.  Just make sure it is balanced as even small items can really mess it up.<br /><br />I used septic-friendly detergent, so I use the drained water in my toilet tank.  Water conservation to the max.<br /><br />Ironically, it is raining as I write this, and we are having near-record rains.  Still, I will conserve.<br /><br />I haven't saved time, nor do I think I am saving money over using the laundromat.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Extremely labor-intensive, and effective. Ties clothes in knots. High water and detergent usage. Incredible but fussy spinner.", "text": "This machine appears to be identical to http://amzn.com/B01ICBLBL0 (Best Choice Products), except for minor cosmetic differences. Surely the same manufacturer. (Which seems common among things in this class.) This review is for that machine, which I purchased from Amazon.<br /><br />To minimize the water-wasting and labor-intensiveness problems, get the large size - typically listed as 11 to 13 lbs capacity. (Don't worry, it is still small and light.) To minimize the knot-tying problem, always use small washable laundry bags!<br /><br />This is obviously meant to be used in a bathtub or shower. The inlet &#34;hose&#34; is completely useless (but might make a fun drinking straw), and the gravity drain hose is only long enough to get the water to the floor. The only way to fill it is with a detachable shower head, regular hose, or a bucket.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />* Clothes get cleaner than from any other regular consumer-grade or laundromat washer you've ever used. Seriously.<br /><br />* The spinner is far more effective than regular washers. (Thanks to a much smaller size and correspondingly lower mechanical demands, with significantly higher RPM, and overall more angular momentum.)<br /><br />* Very fast. You can get a a wash/rinse/spin/rinse cycle done in less than 20 minutes.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />* Extremely labor-intensive! You have to move the clothes no less than NINE times between dirty clothes hamper, and dryer! (Load dirty clothes into tub for wash, move half of washed clothes into spinner, remove spun clothes, move other half into spinner, move spun clothes into tub for rinse cycle, move half of rinsed clothes into spinner, remove spun clothes, move other half into spinner, move spun clothes into dryer.)<br /><br />* High water usage for the amount of laundry capacity it can handle without choking.<br /><br />* Ignore the people that say you don't need much soap. For typical soil levels, you need 1/2 to a full capful of liquid detergent.<br /><br />* If you put too much clothes in it (more than 2x spinner's worth of dry clothes), it will grind and fail to circulate clothes properly.<br /><br />* This machine ties long sleeve shirts, pants, and straps into knots that Houdini would struggle to undo. (You MUST put those items in wash bags, or your clothes will literally be one big knot and won't get clean.

(We used the toilet) The cord is pretty short so get an extension cord if your outlet isn\u2019t close by. The tubes they come with don\u2019t fit my sink faucet so we use a bucket to put water inside the washer. The \u201cdryer\u201d like every one likes to say isn\u2019t a dryer, it a spinner. You\u2019re clothe will still need to be hung to fully dry after using that. Keep that in mind. The drain system is gravity based, meaning the washer needs to be elevated in order for it to drain. We got  a shoe rack from target and placed the washer on top of it that way it\u2019s elevated.<br />This product does require you to by other things to make it convenient to use, but in general it does it\u2019s job.

The washer sits perfectly in this tub and I used the Styrofoam packaging from bottom of box to help with potential noise.  I couldn't be more thrilled with this unit!  My apt. is on the second floor and dragging baskets of clothes up and down to take to laundromat was a huge problem.  Now I can wash at home!  I will say, I will still take bigger heavy items to laundromat such as large bath towels, jeans, small throw rugs - it is common sense not to do more than the machine was made for.  The washer side is large enough, but the spin dryer is smaller so heavy items wouldn't work. At least as far as my thought process.  I fill the washer with water by hand as the connection won't work with either of my sinks.  But that is MUCH easier to fill and pour dishpan of water than the whole trip to do laundry.  It was interesting to see the dirty water going down the drain!<br /> I didn't think my clothes were THAT dirty but great to know they are really getting clean in the washer.<br /> Agitation is incredible for such a small machine and the spin dryer really extracts the water from items.  I stand at the machine when starting spin dryer as it sounds like a lawn mower for first few seconds and tends to shake unit, so I hold it to keep steady for those few seconds.

Functional and  fairly easy to work.  But I had to learn by watching many videos.  The instructions were not that helpful.  My messes were the result of losing control of the hose while draining water, and from spilling while filling the machine with water with my shower hose.  Consequently, I had to wash another load, this one consisting of towels I used to mop up water from spillage.  Two things left me baffled while using this washer/spinner:  1.  If the manufacturer knows you need to elevate to machine 4 inches in order for it to drain properly, why didn't they just add 4 inches to the base instead of requiring the buyer to buy something additional to use the machine; 2.  some type of rack should have been attached to the machine to wrap the cord around when not in use--similar to vacuum cleaners.  Due to these two design flaws, I am giving this washer/spinner 4 stars instead of 5.  I will try using the washer in my bathtub, as I've seen some others do in their videos.  Seems less messy.  I'll have to get an extension cord for that. One final thing.  The hose for the water inlet that I received has some dirt and glue on the end that you attach to a water source, which leads me to believe that it was previously used.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Love it!!!!!!", "text": "I love this portable washer!  It works great for my little studio home as I have on washer/dryer hookups nor space for a full size washer and dryer.  As previously noted by other buyers, the sink attachment hose doesn't work unless you go to a hardware store and get a special rig for it.  However, I do just fine filling up a bucket with water and pouring it in.  The instructions are hilarious as they make no sense whatsoever, but you don't really need them.  It's easy to use just by looking at the machine dials.<br /><br />Washing:<br /><br />You only use a tiny amount of detergent.  If you use to much, you'll have to do an extra rinse cycle.  For my rinse cycle, I dilute a small amount of fabric softener so my clothes come out soft and non-wrinkly.  You can do a decent sized load in the washer of shirts, underwear, socks, and non-jean shorts.  For towels, it washed three full-sized bath towels easily.  For jeans, I only do a max of two mens jeans or three women's jeans.<br /><br />Lint:<br /><br />It has a lint tray, but it's not very good.  Since I have the hose draining into my shower, I put a kitchen strainer in my shower drain to catch all the lint from the clothes.  After each load, I clean the lint tray in the machine and wipe up any lint residue in the machine basin.<br /><br />Drying:<br /><br />This spin dryer is excellent.  Clothes come out barely damp.  If I'm washing smaller, light items, I can usually arrange and fit the whole load evenly in the spin dryer and I spin for 2 minutes.  For heavier items like jeans or towels, I do them one at a time and set the timer for 1 minute.  Make sure to evenly arrange the clothes in the dryer or it'll rattle and move around like crazy and probably wear out your machine quickly.  Once dry, I hang them out to dry on my clothing rack dryer.  When you're done with all of your laundry, I pick up the machine to get any excess water out of the hose.  It's super lightweight so no back problems here!<br /><br />I've recommended this dryer to all my friends that have to go to the laundromat and they're excited to buy one of their own.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Works Surprisingly Well.  Spin Dry Is Amazingly Good.", "text": "Works surprisingly well.  I have an extra large washer, but the wiring and plumbing in this newly acquired +100 year old farmhouse needs to be completely redone.  The plumbing can in no way handle the output of my washing machine, so I bought this for the interim and let the bathtub handle the excess water.  The only things to be mindful of is that it'll handle only so much.  I can do a couple pairs of shorts, tee shirts, skivvies, and socks in the summer, but only a pair of lined jeans, a hoodie, a tee shirt, skivvies, and socks in the winter - not even a day's worth of clothing.  I think the key is that the clothes have to be fully floating to agitate correctly, meaning fill it up to the overflow every time.  I typically run two wash cycles for every load to get things clean.  Again, I live on a farm and my clothing tends to get pretty dirty, so YMMV.<br /><br />The spinner is crazy good, but limited as well.  I spin half a load at a time for just one minute, then run yet another wash cycle as a rinse cycle, then one minute spins on half loads to finish.  From there things go into a Magic Chef MCSDRY1S 120 volt mini dryer which is also surprisingly good.<br /><br />I keep forgetting to buy laundry detergent, so I've been using a tablespoon or two of Dawn (a good squirt, really) and a couple tablespoons of borax.", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AEZYFVMVDR5PWPQUSS6COAZU6R2Q", "timestamp": 1516061122752, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}
{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Amazing choice for small spaces", "text": "THREE MONTHS. I waited three months before writing this review because I wanted to accurately attest to the longevity, functionality, practicality and overall efficacy of this machine.<br /><br />Longevity: So far so good. I haven\u2019t worried at all whether or not it had died on me.<br /><br />Functionality: It cleans well enough for a machine this size (definitely beats hand washing, which is what I was doing beforehand). Our family loves the outdoors. We\u2019re covered in dirt from head to toe often. I do small loads (less than half the wash bin full) and it cleans well enough. Just wash the load again if all the dirt doesn\u2019t come out in the first wash. It dries about 80% of the water. I do hang out all the clothing I wash to dry. Takes about 20 minutes for most clothing to dry. Jeans and towels take closer to 1 hour, but considering this thing can handle jeans and towels, I\u2019ve got no complaints.<br /><br />Practicality: I have a 700 square foot apartment. This fits nicely in our tiny kitchen. I barely notice the space it takes up. It\u2019s easy for me to haul it from the kitchen to the bathroom, and I\u2019m not a big person.<br /><br />Efficacy: I love this machine because it does what it\u2019s designed to do: provide in-home laundry for tiny spaces. It does what I expected it to do. It\u2019s a definite game changer.<br /><br />Here are things I learned:<br />1. Pack the washer at most 1/2 full. If it\u2019s too heavy (due to water or clothing), it won\u2019t wash as well.<br /><br />2. Fill wash bin up to the second line on the filter. Any more and you risk leaking. Don\u2019t up your water bill just to wash water down the drain.<br /><br />3. The dryer usually holds only 1/2 of what was in the washer.<br /><br />4. If you\u2019re washing jeans, wash only 1 pair at a time.<br /><br />5. Less water for smaller loads is fine. I always fill at least to half-way mark to avoid stressing the machine.<br /><br />6. Turn knob to NORMAL for washing and DRAIN for draining and drying. If you do back to back loads, make sure to switch the knob back to NORMAL so your washing water doesn\u2019t simply drain out.", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AGLNWDXYGOLGXIWWDAMGHF42N6OA", "timestamp": 1630181315316, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Good washer - Bad delivery", "text": "This is my first small portable washer.  I've used it a few times now, and am satisfied with it getting my clothes clean.  The washer side is simple to use, just remember it is only for smaller loads.  The side with the spinner works well, but I was disappointed in the size of the spin basket.  It is half the size of the washing basket, so you have to spin half a load of clothes at a time.  Having said that, the spinner gets results like a regular washing machine.  All the water was spun out, and it took little time for my clothes to dry (hanging up).<br />The washing machine is rather noisy,  especially if you,  like me, have to sit it in the bathtub when washing,  mostly for water drainage purposes.  I recommend a small sturdy stand to put the washer on,  so the drain hose can be laid over the side of the bathtub to drain into (washer must sit slightly higher than the tub or area its draining into; at least 2-4 inches at minimum).<br />The reasons I gave a 3 out of 5 star rating were:<br />1 - the machine,  when washing,  is very noisy<br />2- ***The package,  upon arrival to my home,  was torn up, literally falling apart, being held together by the plastic straps,  with the bottom loose from the rest of the box, as well as improper packaging  (no padding inside box and the machine was just jostling around inside).  The box, the machine arrived in,  also looked as if it had been opened and repackaged (new packing tape sloppily over the original tape).  Once removed from the box, the machines electrical power cord was chewed up.  It appeared to have been caught under something and scraped across.<br />All in all, it appeared the washing machine was a  returned product,  to Amazon,  which was sent to me in extremely poor condition.  Further more,  I never extended any indication I'd accept a used product,  especially when paying full price (cost of machine brand new).", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AEJVOZMKBFZFHNGOFBXNSI24P4NA", "timestamp": 1563436821458, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}
{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Still happy after 6 years of constant domestic use.", "text": "I'm updating my remarks from 6 years ago by saying that I remain happy and very impressed with this machine.  I use it frequently, several times a week.  I've learned to maximize it by doing small loads often.<br /><br />I still have a lint problem considering my two cats and use a lot of lint rollers and my vacuum cleaner.<br /><br />Nevertheless, if one is willing to do the manual components of monitoring the wash, this machine is well worth the expense. Very durable and helpful compared to using the coin laundries.  If you live alone and don't have laundry hookups, this is a great answer.  Easily lifts in and out of the shower for use.<br /><br />Review on Purchase 2016:<br />I'm giving this five stars because it surpassed my expectations in every way.  It is more substantial and heavier than I expected, and the motor is up to the task of washing a queen bedspread. Plus, I've been using a coin operated laundry for 5 years, and this is so much better than making that journey, waiting in line, and all the other nuisances of sharing facilities.  But to be prepared to enjoy this, first toss out any idea you may have of &#34;automatic washing machines&#34;.  This is not automatic.<br />1) The connector to the sink is ridiculous and won't work in most cases. But it's easy.  I place my washer in the shower and simply unscrew the sprayer head and attach the hose to fill.<br />2) similarly, the electric cord is too short. I'm using an extension cord but caution that of course no extension should be allowed to drag on the floor depending on where the outlet is because should the hose become detached one may experience a spray of water all over the floor and bathroom which could cause the shock referred to in the directions.<br />3) The machine will seem to start and stop - that's o.k. The rotator is simply changing direction.<br />4) Naturally, you will have to drain and refill for as many rinses as are required.<br />5) the clothes seem to get thoroughly washed, but cat hair is still a problem.  Electric dryers remove cat hair.  The filter in this washer does collect  lint, but there is still quite a bit of cat hair on the clothes after a round in the spin drier.  Never mind.  Cat hair is a manual process anyway.<br />I've been using this machine about a week nearly every day and am pretty happy with it.", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AGMS52MTQ4EC7D7EVZ3UAW62FEXQ", "timestamp": 1479330495000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": true}

I was forced this year to move into an apartment that did not have washer/ dryer hookups. Went to the community laundry mat one time and decided I would try and find an alternative.<br /><br />I ordered this. It arrived quickly packaged very well and when I opened it I laughed at it because it was so small and made of plastic I just assumed it was a piece of crap that wouldn't<br />Work and that I had been ripped off. I even began the process of returning it. But the Box got lost in the shuffle of moving and it took me two months to find it. By then, I owned it.<br /><br />I finally got around to breaking it in.  I've been up all night washing clothes in this thing and I am amazed at how clean it's getting everything and how dry the spinner is getting everything. Some of my clothes were spun dry enough I could have worn  them right then and there.<br /><br />This would be perfect if the hoses were longer and if the rinse cycle was longer instead of having to turn the dial every 5 minutes to add more time.<br /><br />It's already paid for itself. I spent about $100 for it and I have done more than $100 worth of laundry since I started using it. I bought a dolly for it and it easily moves from room to room as needed and I can put it in the closet can put it out of sight when company comes but I leave it out because it's so cute and everyone is so curious about it. I do recommend this for anyone living in a small space who hates going to the public laundromat.<br /><br /> December 2016 update<br /><br />I meant everything I said in the above review, however using this thing daily for almost a year, I find myself wishing this thing had a better inlet hose, a better drain hose, and a pump to drain the water out. Also even though it's like I wish it had casters or something. I'm getting tired of lugging it around LOL. Finding replacement hoses for this thing is a nightmare, at some point I just gave up and decided to go ahead and buy a fully automatic portable washing machine because it has the Quick Connect hose, a pump and wheels.

We use it daily and love it. It's not a full size washer of course but it's perfect for our small apartment. The washers and dryers in our apartment buildings are gross and expensive. So is the laundry mat. This saves so much time and money. The washer holds quite a bit of clothes. You can wash a sheet or two, kids blankets, and any clothing with the exception of maybe a very large winter coat. The dryer is smaller than the washer so keep that in mind. One wash load is two dry loads. They don't spin 100% dry but pretty close and definitely not dripping. An hour or so (depending on fabric and size) hanging up and they are dry! Highly recommended. Plus, grab the super cheap 5 year warranty just in case!<br />Also, an easier way to fill is just taking our shower head with hose and putting it directly into the washer tub and letting it fill.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "The breakdown of time, water consumption, and efficiency...", "text": "I'm impressed.  This little machine packs a lot of power. I am happy to list both pros and con's of this machine. I've owned another brand (Panda) and model of this same type of machine. I bought it roughly a year ago to date and love it. It also gets clothes exceedingly clean and fresh, no spot or stain goes untouched. Even hard to get out grease spots from cars, etc. Both the Panda brand comparable machine and this Conway machine accomplish the objectives. With that being said, here are the Pros to owning this machine verses other similar compact twin tub washing machines. And verses regular sized standard machines<br /><br />1.  If used properly it does in fact save water. I've done a comparison to the amount of water used in my standard full size washing machine and this particular model of twin tub compact washer. Again, IF used properly, and you do not over load the machine,(which means a small load -roughly 1 pair heavy denim jeans, 2 cotton knit shirts some socks, 3-4 pair of boxer or panties, a couple of hand towels/ OR a lightweight sheet set & pillow cases/ OR 2 large bath towels, 2 hand towels & 2 wash cloths) you use roughly 6-7 gallons on each cycle. Compared to 15 gallons per cycle for similar sized small load in a regular full sized washer. By cycle I mean each stage of washing. The main wash cycle, then a refill after spinning (rinse/softener added), spin again, then the final rinse & spin. You have the option to rinse while spinning each spin cycle however I find you can opt that aspect out and the clothes are still rinsed properly. It saves on wear & tear on the spin motor. (they tend to burn out easily on these machines if over loaded  or weighed down)<br />*Total wash time can be narrowed down to 19-20 minutes if your cloths aren't heavily soiled. Breakdown on that time table is as follows:<br />5 minutes for wash cycles (drain while adding clothes to the spinner to save time,  clothes will spin out fine even when drippy wet)<br />2 minutes on initial drain<br />2 minutes on spin cycle  (heavy clothes will need maybe 3 minutes)<br />3 minutes on rinse refill - fabric softener added during this stage  (when small load and with 6-7 gallons of water used)<br />2 minutes on second spin cycle<br />3 minutes on final rinse refill and cycle<br />2 minutes on final spin/ Then goes straight to clothes line or dryer depending on weather.<br />19-20 minutes total time.<br />**Heavier loads, larger loads or loads that require soaking, or longer washing & spin cycles will of course, take longer.<br /><br />2. Compared to other machines of comparable size/function others take longer to drain with the pump drain feature. This is a gravity drain which requires it to be elevated off the floor /surface & near a drain outlet to work properly. This can be accomplished by placing in a large full sized shower stall or tub in a bathroom, OR on a counter in the kitchen/laundry room then drain fed into a basin/sink. OR placed on a physical lift/sturdy flat wide object then placed near floor drainage in basement, etc. Simply switch to drain option and it does the work rather quickly. The Panda brand machine uses a motorized pump drain & can take quite awhile to actually pump out the water. Usually 10 minutes compared to the 3 minutes this Conway machine takes using gravity with no motor pump to break down or wear out (which happened to my panda machine which thankfully was under warranty)<br /><br />3.  You can do larger loads even though the wash basin & spin tub are smaller. This is due to the power of both the washer & spin motors.  I've washed 4 bath towels, 4 hand towels 4 wash cloths at once, they all got clean. I've washed a full king sized heavy jersey knit sheet set, it came out fine, highest water level used (10 gallons). Still a water saver compared to a standard regular sized machine. Times for each cycle & spin were slightly longer (roughly 2 mins added to each timer) with a normal full sized small load of clothes (5 knit tops, 4 pair of socks, a pair of lightweight pants,  3-4 pair underwear.) water was filled to just bellow the lint filter top and run on the lowest setting for 15 mins. Everything came out clean & fine.<br /><br />I've read in comments that people have difficulty with some clothes coming out torn. I've never had this happen on either machines of this kind. don't over load your clothing or add delicate fabrics like thin knits and silks or light weight fabrics to the machine on a heavy load and not enough water, and set your delicate fabrics to soft cycles and you should be fine. I've washed  my satin nightgowns, lace panties, or dress slacks for my boy & husband several times and it's all in tact. Read your labels on your clothing & use common sense and you will be fine.<br /><br />Ok so the cons:<br />1. If you aren't able to stay focused on just doing the laundry at each interval it can be longer to do a single load given each phase of the load requires  manual exchange from washer tub to spin tub & back again.<br /><br />2. You have to e mindful of the water filling the basin. It is manual. You can choose to hook up the hose to a water source and fill it  OR opt to use buckets, gallons, ect to fill it by hand but that's a bit more time consuming and lots heavy lifting. I opted to hook it up to my bathroom shower outlet by unscrewing the shower head and using a small o-ring to tighten the hose to the pipe itself. A simple flat head screw driver (or butter knife if you're lacking a flat head screwdriver) then tighten it so there are no leaks.  I used the rubber bulb (top) of a turkey baster with a cross slit cut into the rounded top side and attached it to the faucet with the panda machine hose. However the hose on this machine is slightly more narrow/smaller and wont fit the same.. It's a bit DIY depending on your water outlet/faucet/ pipes, hose, etc. but nothing complex. I recommend using a timer set on your mobile phone or a dial timer to set each fill basin so you don't have an overflow problem. (I found this out the hard way when I didn't realize this machine would not automatically shut off the water fill like my regular machine) So a timer helps..ALOT.<br /><br />3. If you're looking for a quiet machine that makes little to no noise or expect that there will be no water touching your skin, ever OR if you're looking for large capacity or little effort in doing laundry, this is probably NOT the machine for you. If you're into saving water, your time is valuable , and you just like really clean clothes that can be done in a simple efficient machine that may make a little normal racket from time to time on a spin cycle winding down, or you need a decent good machine for a small space then this is your dream come true.<br /><br />TIPS:<br />I use HC friendly laundry pods (specifically Gain Pods). One pod for each load gets everything really clean & fresh without too many suds. I use Oxi Powder (3 tablespoons for 6-7 gallons of water, 1/3 cup for anything over 7 gallons water) This helps to deodorize, sanitize and is a  color safe &#34;bleach&#34; without using harsh chlorine that also wears down the thin plastic hoses quicker.<br /> I also place my washer on heavy grade plastic cube crates tied together with zipties to keep them stable and together to elevate it for the gravity fed drain then place it in the tub in the bathroom. The water doesnt splash on the floor & the drain water goes right into the tub  & down the drain, no fuss no mess. Any leaking it may or may not have ( I personally have not experienced any leaking with mine but some customers have said this can be an issue for them) is not a worry since everything is contained in the tub/stall. The electrical plug obviously goes outside the tub & up away from the water source. A small watt appropriate extension cord can be helpful in keeping everything dry & helps if you need more length in the cord to reach an outlet. Be mindful of the wattage that your outlet cranks out so you don't blow a circuit running the machine in the bathroom on a circuit not meant for that kind of motor/ampwattage(this has not been an issue for me, just wanted to include it)<br /><br />All in all this is a great machine. Very efficient. Since I now own 2 of these types of machines for the price of one standard full sized machine  my clothes have never been cleaner.and is a huge time saver for me to be able to do 2 separate loads of 2 different kinds at the same time. It's also space savvy for anyone in a tiny home, apartment, RV, Boathouse, or just a really space conscious person. It's light weight & can be reasonably lifted to store away. This is a lighter machine than the other brands of comparable capacity, function & size.  significantly lighter in weight than my Panda machine of comparable size. I also recommend getting the warranty on it.  For the price, it's a good safety measure to have in the event any mechanical issues or parts are faulty. The customer service is friendly and helpful if you are also friendly and polite.", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AGBRDD5SVI6W7EBBRCODDDO6E2RQ", "timestamp": 1494655871000, "helpful_vote": 32, "verified_purchase": true}

The real time saver is in the drying attending time, 5 mins to spin dry then the rest is air dry. Swap our your dryer sheets for fabric softener/vinegar mixture, run that in your rinse cycle, then spin dry and air dry for at least half a day.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Fantastic Beast!", "text": "The product is listed as a Giantex washer but my washer, as in the image of the product in the ad, is as a Costway product. I don't know what the difference is - The Costway Giantex model?<br /><br />I have four floors of living space and the laundry room is in the lowest level (basement level).  I have a full-size washer and dryer, but little motivation to walk down to the laundry room to wash and dry small loads.  I bought this machine for the bedroom levels. This washer makes it possible to wash items you might need the next day, but are too few to wash in a large washer.  It is also good for keeping teens from creating massive piles of self-walking laundry.<br /><br />Without an agitator, make no mistake about it, this small lightweight washer is, in essence, a miniature top loader and is highly effective in removing dirt and stains. I have used this machine often since purchasing it. There are two wash cycles: \"soft\" (for delicate clothing) and normal. The normal cycle is actually pretty strong. The normal cycle removed a kid-friendly food stain from a white shirt - pre-treating the shirt as I normally would.  I have also washed a queen-size sheet set with room left over. I purchased this particular machine because of its relatively large wash capacity.<br /><br />There are so many pros, with so few cons.  It may be annoying to have to transition clothing from the wash basin to the spinner, and back, but even then, it takes less time to wash a load of clothing in this mini top loader than my full-size front loader.  The spinner is as amazing as cited in other reviews.  The clothes are nearly dry when leaving the final spin cycle.<br /><br />The only real con is the hose attachment.  It is useless to fill the washer.  Others have posted solutions to avoid the issue of the useless fill-hose.  If you raise the washer high enough  to avoid the electrical outlet when draining, you can place the washer in the shower and use the shower hose to fill to wash tub.<br /><br />My only other concern about this machine is not so much a concern but a gentle warning.  It would be easy to become overly reliant on using it -  which means you could end up using more water than you save. HE washers use between 15 - 30 gallons per wash.  This machine, when washing a full load, uses around 5 gallons.<br /><br />Overall, this is one of the best purchases I have made through Amazon.  My daughter-in-law loved it when she saw it. I am planning to buy one for her and my son to help them manage the endless toddler/preschooler laundry battle.  This machine is advertised as great for people who are in small spaces or who don\u2019t have ready access to a larger washer/ dryer, I think it is far more flexible than that.

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "DEFECTIVE UNIT & VERY POOR CUSTOMER SUPPORT", "text": "The first thing I noticed upon receiving this machine was that the unit had rusty nails and was dirty and scuffed up as if it was a return. I contacted the third party Seller to exchange but they did not initially respond. I then contacted Amazon to complain. The Seller finally responded by asking me to take several pics, make a video and to complete their questionnaire. Annoyed, I contacted Amazon a second time and they sent the Seller a notice asking them to simply replace without me having to do the video, pics and questionnaire. The machine was now out of stock so I decided to  try it out while waiting for a resolution. Well, the spin cycle stopped working after two uses and there was a lot of loud clanking from the motor on the washing side - although I only had 5 t-shirts in the load. I followed up again with the Seller but never received a response. I was under warranty so a return/exchange should not have been an issue. I once again followed up with Amazon and expressed that I wanted to resolve the matter while still within the warranty/exchange window. Amazon assured me not to worry, that a record of the issue had been documented and the matter would be resolved.<br /><br />Please note that Amazon would have fulfilled the replacement but they did not have the same washing machine in stock as the third party seller.<br /><br />When I called Amazon yet again, I was now outside of the return window. Amazon apologized, and expressed embarrassment for how this return/exchange had been botched. Amazon subsequently sent another message to the Seller and assured me that I would receive a refund if the Seller didn't respond within 48 hours. Period. Well, the Seller did not respond. I called Amazon to request the refund I was promised. However, the representative I spoke with about-faced on what was promised, saying there's nothing they could do since I was outside of the return window...(sigh). I requested the matter to be escalated but once the pandemic hit, Amazon ceased its phone support and I can't get anywhere via their online support system.<br /><br />So, BUYER BEWARE.

Would avoid this seller and this product!<br />The only reason why I am giving it the 3 star rating is because there was a lot of trial and error with thing regarding how much soap and water to put in. Also make sure you put the clothes in the wash and spinner evenly. You need less than a teaspoon of detergent and water should be just above the clothes. We used the showerhead to put water in instead of the hose that comes with it it is a lot easier. Only put half your wash in the dryer do not overkill it otherwise it will go under the drum.

The spin unit is very handy, gets most of the water out though I do hang things up overnight to complete drying.  I have it set up in a shower that is not used and just let it drain there, I don't need to elevate it as some people do.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "CONVENIENCE OVER EVERYTHING", "text": "I live in a house with roommates but there is no laundry machine :-( I HATE public laundromats and it's ultimately the biggest hassle because I have to stay there until it's done since I don't feel comfortable leaving and coming back. After debating and researching for a couple months, I finally decided to purchase this. I'M SO HAPPY I DID!!! Having my very own mini laundry machine (Washer & Spinner) in the comfort of my own home/room is amazing! I watched many video reviews and read all the amazon reviews prior to purchasing it, and again when I received it before testing it out. The manual is a joke and hard to understand so don't even bother. Although, it does mention to keep away from water. Many users seem to keep it in their bathroom/shower, but I want to avoid any/all risks so it's actually in my room!.<br /><br />The main complaints with this appliance are that the drains/tubes are short/small/useless. Because it is drained by gravity (the appliance must be elevated so that the tube can be facing down to drain all the water. I have a mini tv stand and just placed the machine on top of it. I also have a huge bucket which I placed under/next to it so that it can drain all the water. I don't use the thinner tube that you're supposed to use to fill the machine with clean water. I simply use another huge bucket and pour the water into the washer tub directly. That way, I don't have the struggle/problem of the tube being too short or small (seriously, it's useless.) My bedroom is right next to the front door so I have easy access to pour in/out water from the garden hose in the front yard too.<br /><br />You can wash up to 15 minutes each load and can choose &#34;Normal&#34; or &#34;Soft&#34; setting. I washed my delicates and socks together for my first load (roughly 20 undies and 15 pairs of socks) they are all very thin and light so it actually all fit without any worry/paranoia that it was too big of a load. I poured buckets of water so that all the clothes were soaked and until an inch or two of water was above the load. NEVER FILL TO THE TOP! It needs space to swish/wash! I set it on &#34;Soft&#34; and for the full 15 minutes. You only need two or three tablespoons of detergent since the load is much smaller than your average laundry machine. Once it started, it would spin for around 5 seconds and stop for a few seconds. And it repeated the same spin/stop process for the entire 15-minute cycle. A word of advice, make sure there aren't any long strands of hair or strings/loose ends because my lacey undies got kind of tangled. But I purchased a mesh bag for future washes of delicates which solves that problem.<br /><br />After the wash cycle ended, I placed the drain tube into my empty bucket and then changed the setting to &#34;Drain.&#34; (It will drain as soon as you change the setting so you better make sure there's something at the end of that tube because the dirty water will begin draining immediately!) Once the draining is finished, keep the setting at &#34;Drain.&#34; Then place HALF your load (I just separated undies and socks) into the Spin/Dry tub on the right. Place the rubber/plastic lid (provided) directly on top of the load and lay it flat. Close the tub and set your spin time. I set it for 3 minutes. The spin is very powerful! After the first 3-minute cycle, I touched the load and the top portion of the load was 75% dry and the bottom portion was 50% dry (AFTER ONLY 3 MINUTES!!!) I put the bottom of the load on top to get a more even dry and spun again for another 3 minutes. After that, my entire load was 80% dry and ready to hang on my drying rack! It was very clean and I was so impressed!!! Then I proceeded to the second half of the load to spin/dry. Keep in mind it's still on the Drain setting. So you can't wash and dry at the same time. But it's so quick anyway so it doesn't even matter! During the whole process, I'm free to do whatever I want since I'm not at some public laundromat. The convenience is worth the whole bucket thing in my opinion if I compare it to public laundromat visits.<br /><br />The volume level is average. Definitely not silent but it isn't obnoxiously loud like many laundry machines tend to be. For some reason, I imagined the machine to be smaller but it is a very good size for a mini machine. I am still amazed that this sells for under $100.00 honestly even if it was a little over, I think I would still buy it and it would be worth every penny.<br /><br />Always remember to drain after every wash and empty out the little filter inside the washer tub. Remember to unplug the machine after you're done using it. Keep away from direct sunlight or water to prevent any damage. Make sure if you do elevate the machine, it is on top of something flat and sturdy!<br /><br />This is literally my favorite purchase of the year!", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AHYBIW6MIF6BX76MN45UZKZWSOXA", "timestamp": 1468535645000, "helpful_vote": 376, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "My new best friend", "text": "I LOVE this machine. It is exactly what I wanted. I spent several days reading reviews on all the different styles, brands and top 10 lists from credible websites. In the end, I felt like this was the best choice.<br /><br />It took 2.5 weeks to receive it from purchase date, which was earlier than the delivery date Amazon estimated. It was worth the wait.<br /><br />The instructions provided are poorly translated and not very helpful. I used other reviews and videos for clarity and found that to be more useful.<br /><br />Some tips:<br />1. I usually put enough clothes in the main tub to fill the spin tub two times, you'll be surprised how much better this machine cleans your clothes compared to a standard washer.<br /><br />2. Use the water inlet on the spin tub provided to maximize each load and have fresh clothes each time.<br /><br />3. I re-use the same water in the main tub 2 or 3 times before it's drained and then let the machine rest for a few hours. I don't want to overload the motor.<br /><br />4. You don't need much soap to get the job done, I am saving on the cost of detergent and not having to pay for each load.<br /><br />5. I bought a Rinse-a-roo and use that to fill the machine on each side.<br /><br />I am still taking the big stuff to my laundromat -- comforters, towels and large blankets. But everything else is washed through this machine and it's such a relief not having to drag 6-10 loads down my stairs, to the car, into the laundromat and back home again. The money and time saved are well worth the cost.<br /><br />My biggest concern from reading reviews was the machine breaking down after 3-6 months, so I purchased a warranty from Amazon and that gave me some relief.<br /><br />Good luck!", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AFUP2ZRPJG6PWXY3ZHE4EF5RA3CQ", "timestamp": 1610916114255, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Compact and effective", "text": "People already got great reviews to give you the low down on everything about this machine. Thought I'd try and add to theirs a little. I took a picture of it in front of my door to show it's size against an everyday object.<br /><br />I also took a picture of the inlet hose to show why it's pretty much useless, unless you MacGyver it in some way. That is a AA battery I stuck in the hose to show just how small it is vs. any kind of faucet.<br /><br />My apartment has a washer/dryer hookup area so for my setup I bought regular washer hoses then got a 3/4 to 3/8 barbed hose adapter. The 3/8 barbed end fits perfectly into the water inlets on the machine.<br /><br />The noise level isn't too outrageous. As someone else stated it sounds like an AC unit that keeps turning off and on. This is because the motor spins the wash cycle one way, then stops and reverses the cycle the other way.<br /><br />When you start the spin \"dryer\" the machine will shake pretty good, but when it reaches top speed it will steady itself out. As the dryer winds down, it will also shake the same as start up until it comes to a stop. Also, if your item takes up the whole space of the spinner, do not use the water guard disc. It will shoot off into the nook and cranny recesses around the spinner and will be a pain to get it back out. Depending on which side it falls into, you might never get it out without having to dismantle something. I got lucky. I had to attach a hook to a thin broom handle to reach in and retrieve it.<br /><br />I live by myself so don't usually have a ton of laundry most of the time so this machine is perfect for me. Now gotta find a perfect personal dryer and I'm set laudry wise.<br /><br />UPDATE : Got this July 5, 2019. It is now October 3, 2019. So far this thing is working great. I added another photo of my setup. I currently have this on a cheap TV stand. I don't recommend using products for non-intended purpose, as it's a \"use this way at your own risk\" but I accept it. I'm looking for something of the same dimensions with a thicker, sturdier build, but this stand has held up with all the shakes and rattles of this machine. Just wanted to show a possible setup idea for people still wondering what they can do. I do recommend finding a sturdier platform for yours though. I might have to end up building my own platform to replace the TV stand, because it's the perfect dimensions for my space.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YrsCCr77L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YrsCCr77L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YrsCCr77L.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61oy5+MFLnL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61oy5+MFLnL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61oy5+MFLnL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-lLg4eFiL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-lLg4eFiL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-lLg4eFiL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JLWWEUYuL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JLWWEUYuL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JLWWEUYuL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71y7bFL3OXL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71y7bFL3OXL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71y7bFL3OXL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AHBO2I6DC24SBCUM2ADVWAVHT4CQ", "timestamp": 1562949690908, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true}

I bought the extended warranty which I think cost 8 bucks, so I should get at least 2 years out of the machine.<br />I still have to take blankets and big stuff to the laundromat but they don't have to be washed as often as clothes.<br />One word of advice--if you're washing grimy work clothes, don't throw your less-dirty clothes in the same load. Super-grimy or muddy clothes may require emptying and refilling the machine several times and it wouldn't hurt to spin them between agitations to remove more dirty water. Don't add more detergent to the additional washes though, there's enough trapped in the fabric to keep washing them.<br />I have a small farm so muddy, grimy work clothes are the primary thing I wash. I have decided to not keep wearing the same work clothes day after day like I used to because this small machine can only do so much. It will be better to change clothes more often and wash stuff before the amount of dirt overwhelms the machine's ability to get them clean with one or two wash cycles.<br />The spin dryer is amazing. I only turn it on for about 2 minutes and it really removes so much moisture.

I'm assuming it's coming from the back as there is a gap where the door connects that leads to the back of the washer and that is the only place I think this light could be coming from ... Nothing the seller has posted explains this but based on other reviews this isn't an isolated incident. I'm definitely concerned at this point about safety since there has been no answer from the actual seller on this and it appears to be sparking when it switches. Definitely disappointed. It's sad because the washer and spinner work exceptionally well, however with it coming marked up/dirty and being on the flimsier side.. now this potential safety hazard? I recommend investing in something higher quality, reputable, and with great customer service if possible. In hindsight that is what we would have done.<br /><br />I'm leaving this review after 2 days of use and testing and will update if anything changes!<br /><br />Overall: The washer was shipped one day after ordering. We did notice some smudges, scratches, etc. on and inside of the washer which I'm hoping was just manufacturing related... Based on my own experience and others I suspect poor quality control. Everything was tested and functioned as normal. I do worry about the longevity of the machine as it has very strong motors in a plastic body. I did several loads of shirts, pants, jackets, towels, sheets, etc. and overall the machine does a great job at agitating the fabric of various items. Just as others have mentioned, the inlet tube didn't fit our sinks and just to test the functionality of both sides we rigged it with a funnel. Everything worked fine. However, after a few times we opted for the ole' bucket filling method as it went quicker.<br /><br />I would also like to note that when running the washer it had a bizarre odor that you could smell inside and behind the machine. After investigating and not finding anything obvious or concerning, I will assume the motors created this smell. It was very off putting but seems to have decreased with every use.<br /><br />Washer: While the washer is running/filled you can see and feel the plastic moving. It is thick/sturdy enough to hold everything though, just not the strongest body. I don't know that I would ever use it at the High line again as the water tends to splash big time and seems to stress the washer spinner with bigger loads. The part of the machine where the top connects to the body appears to leak when it splashes up to the top as well (included in pictures). Medium and halfway to High seem to have the best functionality and is the most productive with this washer in my experience so far. There were times where the machine handled the amount of items well and would suddenly catch when it would move the clothes in the opposite direction. I would pull something up and back in, and it would be fine again. I suppose to play it safe, less is better and definitely keep an eye on it while it is running. It does switch the movement of washing the clothes very frequently which again makes me question the longevity of the motor. To drain the water you will switch the center setting to drain and it will empty through the drain tube. We had the washer on a raised shelf and drained into a bucket (gravity drain). It worked well enough and haven't noticed any issues at this time. You have the option to set the timer to 15 and honestly for each cycle I have found 6 works well and we added onto it as needed.<br /><br />Spin Dryer: The spinner is very strong and definitely does it's job effectively! You can usually fit around half of your washer load into the spinner depending on what you're washing/spinning. Overloading it will give it a hard time and won't sound good at all. It's loud initially while the clothes \"catch\" onto the sides, and once they have caught, it is actually not bad- sort of like a hum. The trick is to make sure there's not too little and not too much. Balancing the clothes so they aren't clumping to one side helps as well. It comes with a disk to put on top which I'm assuming is to prevent them from popping up and getting stuck in the sides of the part that holds the spinner. Also to keep everything level. While testing the water inlet on this side, I noticed for whatever reason the water leaks just the slightest bit and pools around the inlet while running water through. It gets louder when the water is running into the spinner and quiets down as it drains again. Also, the spinner always drains regardless of the setting- this may have been obvious but just in case I figured it was worth mentioning because I didn't catch that right away. You have an option to run it up to 5. I have found we have never needed more than 1 for normal clothes and 2-3 max for heavier materials like jeans.<br /><br />As for how much the washer/spin dryer can hold... it's not so much how many of each item of clothing as it is the sizes, materials etc. The spin dryer will hold about half of what you wash depending on the material. Even if there is more space available, that does not necessarily mean the machine will handle more very well. If the washer looks like the clothes are catching/stuck with each turn, it's probably too much clothing or not enough water. If the spin dryer is shaking and very loud for more than a few seconds, there may be too much clothing in it or it is not balanced enough. It catches fairly quickly, sometimes immediately if the amount is smaller and you can tell by the gentle \"hum\" it changes to. I recommend testing it out and going from there!<br /><br />Final Thoughts: While the price for the washer and what you get is decent, I was disappointed to see scratches and black specks on the washer lid, smudges on the inside and outside of the washer/dryer and what looked like some kind of yellowish residue in the drain tube. I was also not thrilled with the leaking from the top of the washer with bigger loads. Whether or not we would buy again when needed will depend on how long this washer lasts of which I will definitely update!", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Ltbu3XUzL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Ltbu3XUzL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Ltbu3XUzL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51+NlXXPyhL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51+NlXXPyhL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51+NlXXPyhL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51uiR4zA6iL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51uiR4zA6iL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51uiR4zA6iL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AFLE6ATHR6GTITXK2L3ZC4YFNQ5A", "timestamp": 1677447684514, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Instructions impossible to follow; Better to wash in the sink", "text": "This is a well engineered piece of equipment with motors that run silently and well.  It works just fine, if you don't mind doing about 10x the amount of work it would take to wash the equivalent clothing in your kitchen sink.  I bought this to take in our new travel trailer, and it's a bit big, but that's not the problem.  Problem is you do everything manually from putting the water in (I don't have that much water in my trailer tank, so I have to carry a bucket from an outside pump and I'm not strong), and then move the thing somehow to raise it up high enough to gravity flow.  We'll end up putting wheels on it.  Here's how it works since there are NO INSTRUCTIONS even slightly legible! 1) Put clean water in from a bucket or hose, 2) add a SMIDGE of laundry detergent, 3) put clothes in, 4) use dials to wash clothes about 6 minutes for most, 5) turn drain dial and empty out the bottom hose, 6) refill with clean water from bucket again and again until clothes rinse (same bin as washed in)(add fabric softener if desired but only a LITTLE BIT), 7) once they appear to be clean and rinsed, put into other side (right) but only 1/3 of what you had in the wash bin, 8) spin until they are smashed against the sides, 9) hang to dry because they won't be dry or fluffy, 10) repeat spin for rest of load using only tiny bits of laundry per spin.  NOTE: water will come out of the hose for spin too, so make sure it's draining to somewhere not on your floor.  ALSO NOTE: there's an inlet for water on the spin side too.  Have no idea why, because it comes out the bottom.  I thought that was for rinsing, but it doesn't go into the spin chamber; goes right on out.  Like I wrote - this works well, does what it says it will, but in a trailer you don't have all that water and waste water capacity.  Much better to wash in a little bucket outside with a hose, or if you're in an apartment, just wash your clothes in a sink.  They'll be softer, air dried anyway, and it's a heck of a lot easier!  I'm sorry I wasted my money - really sorry.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "This Is A Great Product", "text": "After losing the use of my regular washer and returning a compact, fully automatic washer that I wasn't able to use, I bought this and honestly, I could not be happier with it.<br />First, a little clarification: The washer/spinner you receive will say Costway on it, not Giantex. This seems to be the only company whose company name is not the same name as on the washer they sell. Evidently, Giantex is the company that sells it and Costway is the the brand name of the washer.<br />No confusion there, or anything!<br />That having been said, the washer does a great job. As others say, it will wash about half a normal sized load and it gets the clothes very clean. I really love the spinner as well, it's powerful and pretty roomy. I split my load of laundry between two spin loads and that's it.<br />Since I don't have a handheld shower head, or any other way to fill the washer, I use a ten quart bucket.<br />At first I really found this to be labor intensive. I would fill the washer with three buckets of water, wash the load, drain it, spin it, refill with another three buckets of water, put the clothes back in, rinse, drain, and spin again.<br />Well, that's just too dang much time and work!<br />Soooo, I've learned the best way for me to not spend my entire life doing a load of laundry is to fill the washer using three full buckets (7.5 gals) of water, which is plenty to do a load at the highest water level, and after washing and draining, I skip the extra steps of spinning and refilling the washer to rinse. Instead, I rinse each piece by hand, put it in the spinner, and Bob's your uncle! So much faster!<br />Also, I only use the soft setting on the washer and I haven't had any problems with my clothes stretching out.<br />At first I could not get the lint trap out, but using both thumbs to press down on the plastic tab, I finally got it out and it works great for me.<br />I keep the washer in my closet when not in use and I use it in my bathtub on a container to keep it elevated off the floor, which I highly recommend. It is a tad heavy and a tad bulky to move back and forth, but nothing I can't deal with.<br />I hope to get about four years out of this for the price I paid.

We've had no problems at all. Just make sure to use a reasonable load size and put it in a ventilated place to dry after use, and it will stay in good condition.<br /><br />Original Review:<br />I really dove deep into the Amazon reviews with this before I purchased it, and I encourage everyone else to do the same. It seems like most of the negative reviews on here are from people who didn't seem to fully understand what they were purchasing. This is NOT an equivalent of a full washer-dryer.

You'll still have to hang dry<br /><br />We've used it 6 times so far and love it. It gets the clothes clean and removes a lot of the water to make air drying faster.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Love Love Love!", "text": "I've been eyeing these portable washers for some time now and I finally bit the bullet and ordered this one. Boy, am I glad I did! I just love this washer! I live in an apartment complex and the management installed high efficiency washers last year. I hate them! I've been washing all of our clothes in this portable washer without using soap at first because the high efficiency washers leave so much soap residue behind! It's been taking me 3 or 4 rinses to get them back to normal again! Gross!<br /><br />There's a definite learning curve and as the other reviewers can attest to, the instruction manual is pretty terrible. I learned with a little trial and error, reading other reviews and watching a few YouTube videos. There's really not much to it, clothes go in the larger tub on the left to wash and in the smaller tub on the right to spin dry. The last load I did was 4 t-shirts, 1 long sleeve button up shirt, 2 pajama bottoms, a pair of shorts and some socks and undies. It really fits a lot! For heavier items like jeans, it's best to wash them on their own. To spin dry you will need to break it up into 2 batches, but it only takes 1 or 2 minutes for that step. I find I only need about 1 tablespoon of laundry detergent per load. I bought a folding drying rack and on a warm day my clothes are dry in about 4 hours.<br /><br />The filling hose did not fit my sink or bathtub, but I found a pretty good solution. I ordered a shower arm diverter for hand held shower heads (the Delta Faucet U4922-PK) along with an extra long stainless steel shower hose. Now when I want to do a load of laundry I set the washer up on a small wood bench next to my bathtub, the drain hose goes in the tub and I can use my stainless steel shower hose to fill the washer up.<br /><br />As others have noted, there was a strong plastic smell when I first unwrapped the machine.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Fantastic! Read for step by step recommendations", "text": "I have had this for three years! I definitely recommend either to reduce trips to the laundromat, or in addition to one's regular washer  to wash cloth diapers, cleaning rags, sandy beach clothes, stinky stuff, cuddle toys, or delicates. Bought one for my mom at the same time, which recently died. Ours still works. Uses a lot of water, but uses very little detergent. Spinner works better than any full size washer's spinner cycle that I've used, helping clothes dry quickly when hung up. The washer only drains when the dial is placed on drain, but the spinner drains continually so items can be spun while washing or while draining the washer. Use liquid fabric softener so clothes dry soft, without air-dry stiffness. Using a rubber band, attach a sock or pantyhose to the drain hose to catch lint.<br /><br />Load capacity: Works best with two pairs of teen or adult sized jeans along with a handful of other clothes, or a couple of sheets, or two to three bath towels, or a small blanket, or a single pillow; basically, if you can fit it in the spinner or in a standard grocery bag, it'll wash well in this tub. Though it can wash twice as much, dividing the load in half to spin, I find that the clothes agitate easily and thus they clean best if washing just what fits in the spinner.<br /><br />Detergent, fabric softener, and deodorizers/laundry boosters: Just put in a little! A tablespoon full or two (or a little medicine cup full, or just a quick dash) of detergent works great, along with that much fabric softener. I use Gain and Downey, and put them in simultaneously instead of doing separate loads. For heavily soiled items, stinky stuff, wet stuff that sat awhile, peed on stuff, etc, just rinse in the spinner until the water is clear, then wash a couple of times with a deodorizer or laundry booster. I like to use Odoban for the bad stuff, or a bit of Washing Soda and a bit of Oxy Clean along with a dash of Gain. Note: Use fabric softener! Jeans, towels, socks, etc will air dry without stiffness, and all clothes will air dry and feel good to the touch if using softener.<br /><br />Washing and drying process: I just wash, and rinse while spinning in the spinner, then let it spin for a couple more minutes. For more heavily soiled clothes or stinky clothes, I'd repeat the cycle. I used to wash, spin, then put it back in the washing tub for a couple of clean-water rinse cycles, but now I prefer just using a bucket of water at a time as it spins, or attaching a hose, to rinse until clear and not bubbly. Here is step by step for various types of loads:<br /><br />Very lightly soiled loads, delicates, cuddle toys: Wash once in washer, then rinse while spinning in spinner. 1) I wash once, with three buckets of water (2 or 2 and a half gallon typical size bucket), a little detergent and a little softener for nine minutes or so. I have also used a hose from the shower or sink, filling anywhere between the lint catcher and the max fill line. 2) I spin the load for two minutes, then remove the clothes. 3) I place one pair of jeans or another heavy item that absorbs lots of water easily back into the spinner one at a time, or half a spinner full of regular stuff. If only half full or less, I do not bother with the cap that stops clothes from jumping up and over the edge while spinning. I pour in a bucket of water and let it spin while refilling the bucket, then pour in another bucket and let it spin, then pour in another bucket and let it spin. It usually takes three buckets per pair of jeans plus three buckets per half load, with the final spin time of about three minutes, but it might take another bucket of water. Alternatively, attach a hose to the connector above the spinner, and let water continually run in while on spin; this requires about three to four minutes of water flow (the connector is small) plus three minutes of spin time once the water is off. Basically, rinse until the water is clear, then spin for a couple of minutes. 4) Place everything on hangers, using clothes pins or clips for smaller items, and hang a few inches apart in doorways or, even better, on a line running across the room. For cuddle toys or pillows, place in front of a fan for a few hours, then flip for a few more hours. If the air isn't humid and if the window is open or the fan is on, everything should dry in a couple of hours. If it has been raining or it is otherwise humid, just have a fan on and leave it for several hours, while at work, or over night and everything will dry well.<br /><br />Moderately soiled or stinky loads: Wash once with detergent and laundry booster, spin or rinse and spin, wash with detergent and softener, then rinse while spinning: 1) Decide whether or not you want to rinse until water runs clear before your first wash. If so, fill the spinner no more than half full, and do not bother with the cap unless you fear socks will jump out. Then, pour in a bucket of water and let it spin while refilling the bucket, then repeat, continuing until the water is pretty clear; usually, two or three buckets is enough, followed by two minutes or so spin time. Alternatively, attach a hose to the hose connector and similarly allow water to flow in until it runs clear, letting it spin for two minutes or so after turning off the water 2) First of two washes: With three buckets of water (2 or 2 and a half gallon typical size bucket), a little detergent and a little softener for nine to fifteen minutes. I have also used a hose from the shower or sink, filling anywhere between the lint catcher and the max fill line. If you want, add a cup of Odoban or a couple tablespoons or so each of Washing Soda and OxyClean.  3) I spin the load for two minutes, then return the clothes to the washer. If I used Washing Soda + OxyClean, I let it spin for a two minutes, pour in one bucket of water, then let it spin for two minutes again. You may want a second bucket if the water is especially dark, because these cause clothes to bleed though they clean very well. 4) Second of two washes: With three buckets of water (2 or 2 and a half gallon typical size bucket), a little detergent and a little softener for nine minutes or so. I have also used a hose from the shower or sink, filling anywhere between the lint catcher and the max fill line. 5) I spin the load for two minutes, then remove the clothes. 6) I place one pair of jeans or another heavy item that absorbs lots of water easily back into the spinner one at a time, or half a spinner full of regular stuff. If only half full or less, I do not bother with the cap that stops clothes from jumping up and over the edge while spinning. I pour in a bucket of water and let it spin while refilling the bucket, then pour in another bucket and let it spin, then pour in another bucket and let it spin. It usually takes three buckets per pair of jeans plus three buckets per half load, with the final spin time of about three minutes, but it might take another bucket of water. Alternatively, attach a hose to the connector above the spinner, and let water continually run in while on spin; this requires about three to four minutes of water flow (the connector is small) plus three minutes of spin time once the water is off. Basically, rinse until the water is clear, then spin for a couple of minutes. 7) Place everything on hangers, using clothes pins or clips for smaller items, and hang a few inches apart in doorways or, even better, on a line running across the room. If the air isn't humid and if the window is open or the fan is on, everything should dry in a couple of hours. If it has been raining or it is otherwise humid, just have a fan on and leave it for several hours, while at work, or over night and everything will dry well.<br /><br />For heavily soiled, peed on, or truly stinky loads: Rinse, wash lightly with detergent and laundry booster just to loosen yuckies, rinse while spinning, wash or wash and soak with detergent and laundry booster, rinse while spinning, wash with detergent and softener, then rinse while spinning. 1) Rinse in the spinner until water runs clear; works easiest if spinner is no more than half full. Pour in a bucket of water and let it spin while refilling the bucket, then pour in another bucket and let it spin, then pour in another bucket and let it spin. It usually takes three to six buckets per half load, with the final spin time of about two minutes. Alternatively, attach a hose to the connector above the spinner, and let water continually run in while on spin; this requires probably five minutes of water flow as it spins (the connector is small) plus two minutes of spin time once the water is off. Basically, rinse until the water is clear, then spin for a couple of minutes. 2) First of three washes: With three buckets of water (2 or 2 and a half gallon typical size bucket), a little detergent, and a cup of Odoban or a little Washing Soda + OxyClean for five minutes, to loosen up the dirt and yuckies. I have also used a hose from the shower or sink, filling anywhere between the lint catcher and the max fill line. Drain, but do not spin the clothes if they're especially yucky and you do not want to touch them unnecessarily. 3) First of three rinses: Decide whether or not to spin and rinse, or simply rinse in the washing side before washing a second time. If spinning and rinsing, use about three buckets of water per half spinner full, by pouring in a bucket and letting it spin while refilling the bucket, then doing so again until the water runs clear. I have also used a hose from the shower or sink, until the water runs clear, then allowing two minutes of spin time. If you do not want to touch truly yucky clothes more than necessary, leave them in the washer, and pour a bucket of water directly into the washer while allowing it to drain right out. Once drained, pour in another bucket, or simply saturate with water for a minute from a hose. Then fill the washer, let it wash (without adding detergents or anything) for a couple of minutes to loosen yuckies, and drain again. 4) Second of three washes: With three buckets of water (2 or 2 and a half gallon typical size bucket) or filling with a hose anywhere between the lint catcher and the max fill line, add a little detergent, and a cup of Odoban or a little Washing Soda + OxyClean for fifteen minutes. Decide whether or not to leave it soaking for a few hours or overnight; if so, be sure to wash for a couple of minutes before draining. 5) Second of three rinses; I spin the load for two minutes, then pour in a bucket of water and let it spin while refilling the bucket, doing so for about three to six buckets until the water runs clear; alternatively, I use a hose to continually rinse the clothes until the water runs clear, then continue to spin for two minutes.  6) Third of three washes: With three buckets of water (2 or 2 and a half gallon typical size bucket) or filling with a hose, add a little detergent and a little softener for nine minutes or so. 7) Third of three rinses: I spin the load for two minutes, then remove the clothes. 8) I place one pair of jeans or another heavy item that absorbs lots of water easily back into the spinner one at a time, or half a spinner full of regular stuff. If only half full or less, I do not bother with the cap that stops clothes from jumping up and over the edge while spinning. I pour in a bucket of water and let it spin while refilling the bucket, then pour in another bucket and let it spin, then pour in another bucket and let it spin. It usually takes three buckets per pair of jeans plus three buckets per half load, with the final spin time of about three minutes, but it might take another bucket of water.

If it has been raining or it is otherwise humid, just have a fan on and leave it for several hours, while at work, or over night and everything will dry well. 10) After drying, does it still stink once it dries? Wash with Odoban or a bit of Washing Soda and OxyClean, then let it soak all day or overnight. Do the typical wash with detergent and booster additives-rinse and spin-wash with just detergent and softener-rinse and spin. If it dries and still stinks, toss it in the trash.", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AH27INANHSQEQEUU63GZWXYN4A5Q", "timestamp": 1563674097154, "helpful_vote": 160, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Amazing little big machine", "text": "I watched videos and read reviews on this and every other portable washer amazon has to offer for months. I waited so long because there were an overwhelming amount of bad reviews amongst the really great ones, especially about customer service if the machine arrived less than perfect. I finally ordered and was pleased it arrived early. The machine came a little dirty but nothing a little bleach and an empty load couldn\u2019t clean. It made a remarkably bad noise unlike any other review video I had watched. I reached out to customer service, who immediately remedied the situation. I am still riding out the defective one and will absolutely put the refund towards the same one when this ultimately kicks it. Clothes come super clean, light on detergent, easy to move although I leave it on my kitchen counter most of the time and I use a stool at 5\u20192 . The full hose is laughable but the gravity drain is fine in my situation. I use the kitchen faucet hose to easily fill. The spinner is crazy amazing and extracts 90% of the water, there are already dry patches when they come out. I am able to do a good amount of size 6/7 kid clothes in one load, even a snow suit in two loads and a women\u2019s S lightweight winter jacket with no problem. I always make sure I can see the whirlpool and it\u2019s not struggling to turn, and I\u2019m still able to fit a good amount in there. You have to split the load in half to spin but it\u2019s nbd. I keep a clean pail for the not spun yet clothes while the first batch spins and the basin refills to save time. My experience with customer service was great. This is life changing. Makes things so much easier. The bad noise is only when it spins in one direction, and if both directions spin like the \u201cgood side\u201d does, is say it\u2019s a very low noise level, and after the first few seconds of the spin start, it stays completely still throughout the entire process. I attached a lint sock that I bought at the dollar store in a two pack(this is a must), I have no problem with lint build up on the clothes. For the price, you can not beat this powerhouse. It beats going to the laundry mat, and has paid for itself in the first month alone.

The machine resembles a flimsy plastic children's replica of a washer/dryer at first meeting, I was sure I'd been ripped off. Can't judge this book by the cover.<br />I work at a garden center, and this little machine seems to get all the dirt out. Much cheaper, cleaner and probably safer for keeping clothing than the coin operated washers in our building's basement! The only issue we have is that it doesn't get rid of lint, tends to stick onto our clothes. The washer came with a tiny lint trap, but it didn't help and was a hassle to clean what little lint it did catch, so I took it off and haven't noticed a difference. The spinner works really well, clothes hang completely dry in less than a day after two spins.<br />Overall I consider it a very good buy for $110, we bought it in August and it's still going strong as of this review - Nov. 6 - by which time we have saved about as much as we would've spent at the laundromat. I'll update if it breaks or something.<br />UPDATE 11/2017: It's been one whole year since I wrote that review, and the clotheswasher's still going strong!

I found that I was spending anywhere between $15-$25 a week on drop-off laundry services and it was quickly becoming my largest expense. As I was looking for different laundry solutions, I came across this machine and ordered it immediately based on other customer reviews. I waited exactly 1 week till I found this sitting on the ground floor of my apartment building. The box was pretty damaged and also placed upside down.<br /><br />Some comments on the actual machine: 1) Pretty lightweight, around 20/25 pounds. 2) The instructions are useless, you'll understand how to use the product better by watching YouTube tutorials. 3) The cord for water is extremely short and kind of useless as it's only about 3 feet long.<br /><br />When I first tried it out, I made the mistake of using it in my kitchen and I hated it. Though it was working fine, it was leaking A LOT from the bottom and pretty much got my entire apartment wet. For the next use, I moved it into the tub and it's been working great. I throw in my clothes, leave it to run for 10-15 mins, come back and put the clothes into the spinner for about 3-5 mins. When you drain the washer, you can actually see all of the dirt leaving your clothes. The spinner gets your clothes very dry and if you hang all of your clothes up at night, they should all be completely dry by the morning. I load around 5-10 pieces of clothing. It fits a decent amount, about half of a &#34;normal&#34; load. I would say that a single person should only have to do laundry twice a week.<br /><br />Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase.

First off, you need to put this thing in your shower or bathtub to use it, so you have to lug it around the apartment in order to use it (a hassle). Second, you have to get a special hose to get it to connect to the shower or bathtub spout, so get ready to have to buy a &#34;Washing Machine Drain Hose Extension&#34; in addition to this unit in order to even be able to use it properly (the flimsy thin tube they provide with the packaging is totally useless, believe me!!!). Third, when using it, you have &#34;babysit&#34; the entire procedure. You can't just throw a bunch of clothes in it and expect it to work on it's own like a normal washing machine. TO WIT: By &#34;babysit&#34; I mean you have to continually lift the top of the washer reservoir to move the clothes around in the hot water (yep, actually get your hands down in that hot laundry soapy water!) so that the clothes don't get tangled into an impossible spiders web, something you can't untangle (which they WILL if you leave it alone). Then, after you drain the hot soapy water, you have to re-fill it with cold water, and get your hands down in there AGAIN during the rinse. It's a total pain!  Then, for the Spin Dry side, you have to go 3-5 articles of clothing per spin, which is a huge time waster. All in all, 1 single load of a weeks worth of shorts and t-shirst would take me about 2 hours to totally complete and have ready to dry in the dryer machine (another waste of money item that I bought!

My clothes come cleaner, thanks to the15 minute wash cycle! My only gripe is draining this washer. I cannot set mine in my tub due to the drain being on the right, and drain hose on washer is on left. The washer drain would be facing uphill, causing drain issues. I have to use a 5 gal. bucket to catch the water as it drains. My issue is more of a housing flaw than product flaw. I wish there was a way to hook this machine up to regular washer hose, and drain pipe. I'm thinking that a water hose (with spray nozzle) might be the better solution, so I don't have to constantly turn my water lines on and off, which could break the lines if not handled carefully.

The spinning compartment leaves clothes almost dry, so it's fantastic. Couple of things to keep in mind: there's no pump to get the water out. There is a hose that gets the water out by gravity alone, which means the machine has to be off the floor. I am using an Ikea tv stand. It being from Ikea, and not being solid wood, it hobbles with the movement of the machine. So I also ordered some corner brackets and plates to reinforce the stand and make it sturdier. Success!<br />Another thing to keep in mind, is that the hose to put water in, is too little to work. So this is what I do. I keep my machine/stand in the kitchen. When I have a load, I bring them to the bathroom and use the shower head to fill there washer up and to drain, I just put the hose in the bathtub.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "I LOVE this little washer!", "text": "So far so good! I did a lot of research before purchasing this model. Per the suggestion of other reviewers, I also purchased 2 of the &#34;Generic Flower-type Washing Machine Floating Lint Mesh Bag Hair Filter Net Pouch Blue &#34; to toss into each load to help catch lint/hair, and they do a great job! They're only a few bucks, so definitely worth the expense, folks. So, I'm including a bunch of pics on how I've set mine up.<br /><br />As you all know, the gravity-feed for the drain is an issue to solve in your own way. I solved it by situating my washer right on top of our guest bathroom sink (it also is a laundry room with a water spigot, which I purchased a 10 ft washer hose with a little brass clamp/off-switch (see pics) so I don't have to run back and forth to turn on/off water while trying to fill the washer.<br /><br />In the pics, you'll notice that the sink doesn't look very deep. It's not, but guess what? There's only like...what, 4-6 gallons of water in the washer? There's an overflow hole in the back of the sink, and although the water does come out rather quickly, between the drain in the bottom of the sink and the overflow hole, it has never flowed out over the top of the sink (knock on wood).<br /><br />I have to agree with other reviewers that the spin cycle is GREAT. The clothes come out very well wrung out so that they dry much quicker. I dry as much as I can outside, and when I can't I dry inside on racks. If it's too rainy/humid and my clothes don't dry in a timely manner, I finish them off in my panda stand-up blue fabric dryer...which works pretty well.<br /><br />I know each person needs to sort out their work-around for  1) where/how to drain  and 2) how to get water into the washer.  This is my solution, and I'm VERY happy with it! My clothes come out very clean. I do pre-treat major stains with a bit of laundry soap (or dish soap in a pinch) and let them sit overnight with the soap on the stain before I wash the item. The washer does as good a job of getting stains out and cleaning the clothes as any big washer I've ever used (if not better).<br /><br />I also love that I can more easily choose how long I want each cycle. I may need only 10 mins to wash, 8 mins to rinse, and then 3.5 mins to spin out (which is what I normally do)...or, I might choose to wash for a full 12 (or more) mins for very dirty loads. It's not as easy as all that with regular washers to adjust each cycle and save on electricity! On regular washers, you basically are a slave to a super long cycle using up more electricity than perhaps is needed.

It needs to be plugged directly into a wall, not an extension cord, but I\u2019m going to find a heavy duty one & try that. Anyway, the one thing that bugs me the most is the tiny spin basket. Why on earth would they not make it the same size as the washer tub???  I washed a small fleece blanket. The washer handled it just fine, but the tiny spin basket was too small, so it\u2019s hanging out on my deck railing to drip dry. If the spin basket was same size it would have been fine.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "A Great Way to Do Laundry InHouse (at least as of the first 30 days of purchase)", "text": "It's taken me awhile to figure out how best to make this work without buying additional &#34;stuff,&#34; and I finally think I have it.  Despite the fact that a piece has already broken (more on that later), I'm really glad I bought this, and I did based on reviews; hence my taking the time to write about my experience.  For inquiring minds, it does come in a box that DOESN'T identify what's inside, which is good when your homeowners' docs say &#34;no washer.&#34;  Second, unboxing is a breeeze and it's not too difficult to lift and carry around.  While I wish I had bought a pump washer (and I recommend you consider it) the gravity drain works fine as long as you have it raised.  Despite what several reviewers said, just putting it in the bathtub doesn't work well because it's an insufficient drop.  I had 4 glass blocks which right now are being used to support this.  While it's a tad wobbly, particularly on spin cycle, I've run one load this way and it was fine.  Secondly, the spinner side is INCREDIBLE.  It really, really gets the liquid out and clothes dry much quicker than when you take them out of a &#34;regular&#34; washer and hang them to dry.<br /><br />Despite what many people wrote, I had no problem going to Home Depot and buying some plastic tubing that fits over the water intake valves.  I simply stick the tube in the washer side and put it on the intake valve on the spinner side.<br /><br />As far as washing is concerned, PLEASE be careful when the detergent!  I put mine in a pump soap dispenser and slowly came to the realization that ONE pump of soap is more than enough!  Rinsing the soap out is the biggest issue and ultimately what I do is similar to what someone else posted -- I spin the laundry after washing for 1 minute or so, then put it back in the washer side and re-fill with water and &#34;wash&#34; for a few minutes (generally adding vinegar), then use the spin cycle with water flowing in for 1 minute or so,  and spin without water for 2 to 3 minutes.<br /><br />What has broken is the lid to the spinner side.  The little plastic insert your supposed to put on top of the clothes popped up and actually &#34;shaved&#34; plastic off from the inside and also somehow damaged the top lid so now I have to scotch tape it down.  I don't know what got shaved off, whether it was an inside catch or what, but I had to wipe out alot of plastic, so be sore that insert plastic disc is really pushed down on top of your clothes before you spin.<br /><br />Overall, for the price and quality, I highly recommend this and have now ordered the Panda 3.75 dryer so I can have the full laundry experience in house.  I'll review that after I use it for a while.  I'll also revise this posting as time goes on.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "excellent small machine so far", "text": "Ive been using it as my regular washing machine.  In fact it sits on top of my regular broken washer and drains right into the washing machine drain in the wall.  I'm doing a load as I type.  it's a little noisy and i like to keep an eye on things.  You can throw in a load and then leave the house.  But I'm very pleased.  It gets things clean and I like using natural products, vinegar, Dr. Bronners, etc.  I do find that I prefer to rinse in the washer side instead of the spin side.  I just find it easier.  I drain and then refill and then wash again for a few minutes, then i drain and place load into the spin side.  sometimes it takes two spin loads ;to equal one load of wash.  So i spin half the wash load and then throw it in the dryer.  and then do the rest.  Its a great little machine.  I didnt have $500 or $1000 to spend on getting my machine repaired or buying another, so this is an awesome solution until I have the money.  and as previous posts state, ignore the skinny plastic tube and the instructions.  I put water into the washer via the old washing machine hoses.  I place the hose inside and turn on the water and fill it that way.  I've read that some people use a bucket.  It works great.  make sure dial is on normal and not drain, turn the other dial to the time you need for agitation and voila!  you are washing.  When you are ready, turn dial to drain and then place wet clothes into the spinner.  and then turn dial to the time you need for spinning.  and then you are done.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "A dream! Just put it in the tub", "text": "ETA October 2020: Still using the machine regularly. No complicated setup is necessary. Just put it in the tub when you want to use it. If you have a handheld showerhead, fill the washer up that way (I usually unscrew the actual showerhead to get a full flow from the hose). Couldn't be simpler. Haven't been to a laundromat in years.<br /><br />ETA July 2019: Well it's been 8 months, and I wouldn't take off a single star. I now have a removable showerhead with a hose, so filling it up's a breeze. I sit the machine right in the tub for use, no alterations or props needed. It's not perfect -- towels end up *really* fuzzy, and after drying any wash I have to run a lint brush over everything. But it's worth it.<br /><br />I've had this for just 2 days so far -- wow. I've had to use laundromats my whole adult life, always in walk-up 4th or 5th floor apartments. This is a life-changer. I've done three loads already, and it's really simple and straightforward to use.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- It works! In my most recent load I washed 6 shirts, pajama pants, and several pairs of undies and socks. That's practically 1 week's clothing for me. (adult woman, size 6) That's about 1/3 a typical laundromat load (half of a home-sized washer)<br />- Very easy to use<br />- Lightweight when empty so I can easily move in and out of tub<br />- It's about as loud as your typical washing machine; when I close the bathroom door the noise is mostly muffled. The spinner starts off loud but gets very quiet after a few seconds.<br />- A complete load takes about 30 min including hanging to dry -- compared to 2 hours at the laundromat!!<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The hose, obviously, but see the easy adaptation I came up with below<br />- The spin-dryer is overblown by other reviewers -- it gets clothes about as dry as they'd come straight out of a regular washing machine. Takes several hours to dry.<br />- Lint is an issue. I've been using a lint roller when folding my clothes -- usually there's 1-2 pieces that catch the bulk of it. Also, I suggest washing your clothes inside out. The lint catcher needs cleaning after 2 loads, but it's still not catching a lot.<br /><br />My setup:<br />- I converted a rubber glove to adapt the hose -- see picture. I slip the rubber glove over my showerhead with a rubber band, and I snipped the tip off of one finger, which allows it to fit neatly over the hose. I tied the other fingers into knots to focus flow. I taped the glove to the hose for a little added security. I might get a fancier hookup, but for now, this works great.<br />- Prop the machine on 4 bed risers, and use in the tub. With an extension cord it plugs directly into my sink-side outlet. My building has shoddy electrical work, which is why I prop it out of the water.<br />- When not in use, it sits next to my tub. It's very light to move in and out. I store the hoses and bed risers inside of it.<br />- I use warm water and powdered detergent. Use *very* little detergent!

I definitely also recommend buying the attachments to hook it up directly to a water source as using a bucket is very tedious and time consuming. The first time I used it I spent hours doing 2 small loads with the bucket method. All of that dumping and refilling using my kitchen sink was sooooo slow. The absolute easiest method is to use it in your bathroom so you can attach it to the shower and drain it directly into the bathtub. You also want to set it up on something higher so it drains easily... otherwise it is a pain to drain. I can wash maybe a third of a regular washers load at once so if you're like me and have children you definitely want to wash clothes every day to avoid that weekend pileup where you will spend the whole day washing clothes in this tiny washer.<br />That said - I live in a townhome and there is not a washer/dryer hookup so this is perfect for me to avoid the laundromat.

It's still going strong and I just got done doing several loads in the washer and it still brings a smile to my face when I do laundry.  I have since discovered that the \"Normal\" wash is normal cycle but \"Soft\" would be considered the \"gentle\" cycle.  This washer doesn't agitate like normal washers with the quick back and forth agitation but rather a long spin in one direction and then a long one in the other.  The gentle \"Soft\" cycle does the same it just limits the time in the agitation motion to short spin one way and then a short spin in the other.  The reason why I mention this is because several of my polyblend shirts will stretch out in the water and get tangled up and I end up with a ball of clothes in my washer.  So I wash those separately with other clothes but it's not perfect.  I wash, drain, rinse, spin, rinse with softner and then spin again.  It takes just a small amount of detergent but I ran out and started using my leftover detergent gel packs.  They work just fine and once they are gone then I'll go back to liquid.  Overall, still the best darn thing I've purchased next to my countertop dishwasher.<br /><br />**************************************************<br />I am a live-in caregiver to my elderly mother in a senior citizen apartment complex.  We live in a one bedroom apartment in which we have no washer/dryer hookups, but we do have a laundry room on the first floor all the way in the front of the complex opposite of us. Because of covid I have stopped using the laundry room (or laundromat) especially since a lot of seniors here don't wear masks and we have indoor hallways.<br /><br />I was washing our clothes by hand in big muck buckets with a laundry plunger but that was an ALL DAY JOB just for a few things and it took forever for our clothes to dry on the rack because I couldn't wring all the water out of the clothes.  I decided I had enough and when we got our stimulus money I bought this washer.  OMG this thing is a complete game changer!<br /><br />I cannot stress how much easier this machine is making my life as we have clean clothes all the time and I can do several loads a day with ease.  The spinner, some call it a spin dryer but it's actually there to wring or spin all the water from the clothes just like a regular washer, spins the clothes so well that there are actually dry spots on the clothes when it's done.  I'm not saying it's completely dry because it isn't, but what I am saying is the 9 hours it took me to dry our clothes before when I was handwashing them now only take about 30 minutes.<br /><br />I set the washer in my bathtub, I use a rubber mat under it to ease the vibrations and slippage if any as well as I have to use a sponge on one corner of the machine to make it more stable, then I set my dryer rack in the living room where I have ceiling and regular fans to circulate air around the clothes.<br /><br />Oh there's a lint trap built in that by golly does a great job of catching lint, hair, pet fur and whatnot.  I clean it out each time I wash.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Probably the most life-changing $100 I've ever spent", "text": "I bought this because I moved to a third-floor apartment with no elevator and didn't want to deal with hauling laundry up the stairs. It seemed crazy to think you could get a suitable washine machine for $100 - and I thought the delivery would be a hassle. It arrived in just a few days, and it's a fairly light machine, so it wasn't too hard for me to haul it up to my apartment.<br /><br />As so many others have mentioned, the big hassle is figuring out how to hook it up. I have space in my kitchen, but that didn't seem like it would work for draining. I didn't want to put it on a counter. I put it in a bathroom, and while the room is fairly small, there's just enough space to keep the machine stored in there. I put it in the tub to use it. Initially I was using a bucket to fill it, but that was kind of a hassle. Today I found a funnel that fits perfectly on the input end of the hose. It's the large funnel in the OXO 3-piece set. I bought it at Target, but they have it on Amazon too. You can attach it tightly enough that the funnel will stay attached to the hose even with high water pressure. This wouldn't work with my bathtub faucet because the hose goes up to the top of the machine. I used it with my shower and it worked well. I don't take showers in this bathroom, so the next step is to find a way to attach the funnel to the shower head so that I don't have to hold it up there. EDIT: I used a zip tie to attach the funnel to the shower head. This works well as long as I'm careful about not using too much water pressure. I don't use this shower, so I can leave it in place all the time, but it also would be easy to just turn the funnel out of the way to take a shower.<br /><br />I was surprised by the frequent starting and stopping of the wash cycle, but apparently this is normal. I haven't yet figured out the exact right amount of clothing to put in. I think I put in too much one time, and the clothes came out with some detergent streaks on them. I washed them again in smaller loads and it all came out. So this seems to wash clothes pretty well. I bought an Amazon-branded drying rack, and it accommodates about the same amount of clothing that I can fit in the machine.<br /><br />An important thing to think about if you're switching to this machine from a laundromat is how to deal with drying your clothes and handling wrinkling. I hate ironing and don't want to deal with that. I bought some kind of Downy spray that's supposed to take out wrinkles, but so far I haven't needed to use it. I've been putting fabric softener in and my clothes have been been wearable after drying on the rack. I've only washed one towel so far and it was too stiff.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "No more back breaking hand washing clothes.", "text": "I live in a small apartment with my two children.  My health, as well as my income, is not very good.  Having to go the laundromat is task that I would put off as long as possible.  I have been washing clothes in the kitchen sink, but the detergent often makes my hands burn and it takes 3-4 days for the clothes to dry.  I stumbled upon this item one day on Amazon.com and read the reviews and watched a few videos.  I figured, at a 100 bucks, it would pay for itself in 1 month.  As stated by other reviewers, it can be difficult to find a good place to put it and hook it up to a water source.  I was going to build a platform, but I found a better solution for the time being.  I place it on the kitchen counter and use a step stool to put the clothes in.  I purchased a SharkBite 1/2&#34;x1/2&#34;FNPT straight connector (swivel) from HomeDepot.  After removing the rubber piece from the end of the washer fill tube, I popped the brass fitting in it's place.  Next, I unscrewed the plastic head/handle from the sprayer next to my kitchen sink, with that removed I popped the other end of the brass fitting into the sprayer line.  Voila!  Now I can place the other end of the fill tube as needed on the washing/spinning tub inlets.  Yes, the washer is way off the floor and I have to stick by it, but I don't have to fill it up with a bucket anymore, AND I am able to rinse the clothes as needed during the spinning cycle.  GRANTED - for large items like blankets, etc. I will still have to make a trip to the laundromat- but these types of items never fit very well in my old washing machine anyway.", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AHD7MU5EV4V5F56SZ4JE2PHOTC2Q", "timestamp": 1479304617000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true}

I have a laundry room in our finished basement, but wanted something small for the first floor to wash small loads that I have been doing by hand. I rarely use my big machine or dryer any longer because even with our household if 6, this takes care of everything better than our full sized machine. I have even taught our 4 young boys to use it and we will be purchasing a second for the second floor bathroom. They each have their own drying racks in their bedrooms that are folded away when not in use. My laundry days have become so much easier. Everyone gets their own day of the week to do their laundry and can have it done in an hour. We are saving so much money with this machine.<br />It doesn't wear out the clothes like our HE machine does. We reuse our wash water for 2 to 3 loads, so that saves on water. We hardly ever use the dryer anymore, huge electric savings there. And it saves tons of time. We put shirts right on the hangers to dry and don't have to mess with them again.<br />The spin dryer gets rid of so much water that most things are dry in an hour. I'm so very impressed.  I'm just hoping it lasts. Even if it only lasts 6 months, it will more than paid for itself in savings of both time and money.<br />The biggest reason that I love our portable washing machine is because it actually gets things clean, I mean totally clean.<br />Update: I've purchased 2 of these 5 years ago for just under $107 each. I'm here to replace 1 because the spin dryer motor seized up. I absolutely love them. They cut down on bills; water, sewer, and electric.  I still have my super-sized washer,  but rarely use it.

That was great. The only problem was I didn't want to keep draining into the large bucket and then lifting and emptying the bucket. That's when I moved the machine to the bathroom.

The hose for filling it doesn't attach to any of our faucets and it's really short and flimsy, so we have to fill it by hand with a bucket and it takes several bucket fulls. Technically half bucket fulls, because a full bucket is too heavy and spills everywhere.<br />Had to stand it next to the toilet and attach a rock to the end of the drain hose for weight so it doesn't flail around and it drains into the toilet. I was told it has to be high enough to be able to drain. And this was the only way to have that work and still be able to reach it, I'm 5'1\".  It washed really well, have to run one wash cycle with detergent and fabric softener for the longest setting, then drain, then fill with water completely again and then do a short  cycle, like 6 minutes, With clean water. You can see how dirty your clothes actually are! And how clean they're going to be because of all the dirt coming off and draining away.<br />So you definitely want to do a whole nother cycle with just water to rinse everything off. The spin cycle gets clothes almost dry. But basically one wash load takes 3 spin dry cycles so you have to find a place to leave the wet washed clothes while you're spinning them in batches. If you're doing multiple loads that is, and want to keep it going.  Doesn't take too long to dry after they have been spun 2x. I wish it was a little easier. But it is great and will take some getting used to.  I'm sure we will figure it out and get better at it. We are both disabled. And going to the laundromat is just a pain. Hopefully this will get easier. I had thought we could put it into the bathtub but my friend who set it up for us said it's a gravity drain. And it won't drain properly if it's not high up enough.  It is also pretty heavy for us.  But so is lifting several buckets of water. So I'm mixed on how I feel about it.  I still have to go to the laundromat for stuff. Like blankets, and similar items. Stuff gets spun pretty dry, but then it's sort of wrinkled. Because remember, it's not a clothes dryer.

The washer part is really powerful and got the clothes clean, the spinner really gets the job done and is barely audible. At first it wobbled a lot during spinning, but I figured out it's either my bathroom floor or the feet on the washer that are uneven. It was an easy fix. The water inlet hose is useless, I'm guessing it's designed for faucets in its origin country (China). I used a bucket to fill the washer, I'm gonna have to get some sort of adapter. I had it sitting on the floor, but almost all the water drained just fine into a bucket next to the washer. The power cord is suprisingly long, from what other reviews said I expected a super short cord, but it reaches all the way across my small bathroom. As for the spinner, I let it run for five minutes and the clothes are almost dry. Very impressed!  Be sure to only use a tiny bit of detergent, and I mean tiny, as the washer produces lots of suds. Bottom line, so far I love this washer, it's much better than expected. It loses points for the completely useless manual that is impossible to read, whoever wrote the manual clearly does not speak any English, and also for the water inlet hose.

A couple of things to be careful of:  (1) Make sure when filling the machine on both wash and rinse that the center knob is turned to &#34;Normal&#34; and the hose is engaged on the hook on the side of the machine (up) when filling; (2) after rinsing and draining, leave the drain knob on when spinning; and (3) do NOT overload the spinner.  It will only take about half of the load and does a great job.  May require rebalancing the clothes.  Clothes are spun well and just damp.  I found that a 1&#34; (outside diameter) PVC pipe will fit into the drain hose to lengthen it.  I added another length of pipe to that with a PVC connector to lengthen it more until I can figure out exactly how I want it to drain.  I've done about six loads in this machine in the last few days, and really am very pleased.  Expect a bit of a learning curve.  Be careful about how full it is filled.  I have just used it about halfway.  The agitator is pretty strong.  Also, very, very little detergent is needed.<br /><br />Negatives:  (1) The sink end of the fill hose fits nothing; (2) the power cord is too short; and (3) the drain hose is much, much too short.  This needs to come with an adapter for sink attachment for filling and either a longer attached drain hose and/or an extension to the existing hose; thus, the four stars instead of five.  I found that for me it really was too heavy to be lifting in and out of a tub.  However, it slides easily so if it is able to be slid to somewhere where it can drain, that would work.", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AHLJR5D5S2UCGGOQH7PAFBJDFAAA", "timestamp": 1512253131163, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Amazing product!!!", "text": "Being a single parent and on a budget, going to the local laundromat to wash clothes was not cost efficient at all. Spending over ten dollars to wash and dry, a few loads of colthes and blankets was quickly adding up! Not to mention finding the time to get to there.<br /><br />I bought this unit not looking for a miracle, but a solution to my problem... washing the clothing that my family of four had and trying to save money. This product thus far is doing just that!<br /><br />I wash at least three loads of clothes ( jeans, shirts, socks, delicates, shorts and dresses) and small basic house goods ( towels, sheets, pillow cases, small throw blankets) twice a week. Using a bucket I fill my washer; always making sure to check my load size and the appropriate fill line in the machine. I use less liquid detergent than in a full sized washer and am sure not to use hot water. Depending on the load, I set it to wash for a minimum of 9 minutes to the full 15 minutes. I drain all the water out at the end of the cycle, and then fill the unit with fresh water to rinse for at least 5 minutes. * Always be sure to set the unit back to 'Normal ' or 'Soft' after you finish drain and before you start refilling with fresh water!!! If not the unit will spray water out from the drain hose when you start the machine!<br /><br />One of the best aspects of the unit is the spinner! I usually only place a few items in at a time and spin for 2 minutes. The full 5 minutes is great for heavy items such as jeans or towels. Be sure they are leveled correctly, so that the unit does not start becoming off balance ( you will hear the sound difference when this occurs). When the items come out of the spinner they are almost completely dry. This makes hang drying easier or in my case placing them into my small Panda dryer a quick dry!!!<br /><br />I love my portable washer!

No more dragging everything to the basement.  Hoping for the one machine for 12 apartments.  The $40 bucks for the full month just to have clean clothes!

Because I was just hanging them up.  After some time I went to their website and shopped for a dryer.<br />  But back to washer.  You can wash about 1/2 the size of a washer.  Plus the spin side does a great job getting the water out.  The weakest part on the washer machine looks to be the lint trap.  Mine has NOT broken.  But it looks cheap.  I don't know if I could get another.  But they sell the ones you can just drop in the washer.  For $1 but $8 for shipping.  I didn't order it.<br />  The washer is holding up fine.  I picked up a 3-year warranty to be safe.<br />I am single and it just me.  But it's nice not to have to go somewhere to do your wash.  The machine downstairs broke down but got my money.  Dragging my soaping clothes out to the car to go down the road.  I just wasn't happy in the cold weather.  The washer is sitting on my bathroom sink.  I have it draining into my sink. I fill it with a handheld showerhead that I installed.  I use a hair tie around the head and an S hook to hold it to the washer to fill.  Works for me.  If overfilled it just drains as you fill it.<br />Oh, It manual you have to wash (15 minutes ) the load drain it. Fill it back up with softener and run raise cycle ( 15 Minutes. )  The spin side is 5 minutes.  Load evenly.<br />  Okay - Machine is lite you can move it around.  But there is no pump to drain it.

I went with the wire mesh lint catcher that you can attach to the drain hose<br />- if you have pets their hair kind of lingers on your clothes after washing. I got a pack of agitator balls which helped get the hair off a lot.<br />- the hose won\u2019t attach to your plumbing. I came up with taking my shower head off, cutting a latex balloon open and using that to attach the hose that came with it to where my shower head attaches.<br />-always spin dry heavy things (like towels) on their own if at all. I never did my sheets in the spin dryer because I like how they feel air dried. Towels will feel kind of \u2018crunchy\u2019 if you don\u2019t spin dry.", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AGN73KZPMSK5Z4XPVHTSU73VKTVA", "timestamp": 1610661942465, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Neat little washer.", "text": "This machine is the manual transmission of washing machines. Even so, it will change your life. How amazing to do laundry at home after going to the laundromat for years!!<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, the hose system has some major flaws. (The hose is actually completely useless.) I was too impatient to go the hardware store for a DIY hose-repair project, and filling the tub with a bucket works just fine.<br /><br />If you're going to go with the bucket method, I would recommend dumping a full bucket of water on the clothes in the spin tub and then immediately turning on the spinner to rinse. Do that a couple times until the water coming out the bottom is no longer soapy. Rinsing in the wash tub seemed to take too many drain-and-refill cycles. Also, use about a quarter as much soap as you think you'll need. Getting the soap off was the trickiest part of the whole operation.<br /><br />Some of the questions about the washer express concerns about the lack of a drain pump - I had absolutely no problem. Set the washer in the bathtub and the water drains right out. You don't need a pump.<br /><br />The capacity is surprisingly large. I found that I could fit about half a regular size load in the wash tub, and about 1/3 of that in the spin tub. The spinner only takes 3-4 minutes, so it's not a terrible inconvenience to split the load up to &#34;dry.&#34; Next day edit: I actually washed a queen size comforter in the wash tub. Had to take it downstairs to the community dryer to dry, but washing worked wonderfully.<br /><br />Final note - you'll need a large clothes drying rack.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "My one year review and what I've learned...", "text": "After about a year of use I've learned a few things...<br />*note*..I use this machine in my tub with a bath mat under it for cushioning. After many experiments I find this to be the most convenient for me.<br />1) Put some kind of filter at the end of the drain hose. Maybe a piece of hose or tights attached with a rubber band. You'll want to catch all the lint that the small filter inside misses. Yes there is quite a bit of lint not caught. You do not want that going into your septic or your pipes. Even if you use a bucket and pour the water in the drainage system somehow. I use a few types of filters I purchased off Amazon and put them together to make one filter and tie it on with a zip tie. One is mesh and the other is a metal material. I make a 'filter condom' so to speak.<br />2) Removing and cleaning the small filter inside the machine in between loads will help with lint catching.<br />3) The spinner will wear out before the washer side does. Mine I've noticed is starting to wear out already. It doesn't want to stop spinning sometimes when the lid is open. It's supposed to automatically stop right away for safety.<br />4) A little laundry goes a long way. Do not overload the washer or spinner. A little soap goes a long way. You only need to use a small amount.<br />5) The hose that comes with the machine...unless you can get very creative and make some kind of contraption that will make it fit on your sink or shower hose connection..throw it away.<br />6) It is a good idea to have an indoor/outdoor extension cord. That way if you find yourself washing outdoors you can plug it into a power source. I personally prefer one that can be used both inside and out.<br />7) This machine is not heavy and is very portable. Easy to use when I need it. To me this washer is only used when I can't to the regular washer and dryer that is upstairs from where I live, so I don't use it all the time.<br />8) I've decided that when this machine goes I'll probably invest in something different.

I do not use the filling tube, as that would take too long. I put about seven gallons in. I use just a little detergent. I might add a tad of color fast bleach. I just did a load, I put seven short sleeve shirts and four boxer shorts in there. I could have put a little more. It says not to, but I use hot water. I turn it on at first for just a few seconds to get everything mixed with suds, then I let it sit for 15 minutes. When I come back, the water has cooled a little. Then I turn it on. The unit vigorously churns the water, but unless you are doing just underwear or something, the clothes tend to ball up at the bottom of the tank. I usually stand there and manually pull the clothes out of the ball between churning cycles.  Its not at all dangerous.  I churn things for like five minutes, then turn it off and let everything soak for ten more minutes or so. I might manually push stuff down and around with my hand during that time. Then I drain the water. Usually I squeeze the water out of the clothes when it is draining because I want as much soapy water gone as possible. Then I add about seven gallons of cold water and manually churn stuff around for a couple minutes with my hand to get all the soap out of the clothes. I could turn the machine on to do that, and sometimes I do, but then I have to pull the clothes out of the ball. Its easier to just slosh it around by hand for a couple minutes. Then I drain the water. I like to fill the spinner side with as much stuff as possible, so I hand squeeze some of the water out of the clothes as I pull them out of the washer section. I spin the clothes for like 3 minutes which seems to be enough to get most of the water out of them.  In the end, after drying on a hanger for a couple hours, my shirts turn out pretty good. Not the same as using a real dryer, mind you, but pretty good. Some shirts do better than others, and those that end up wrinkled, I iron. I am happy with my device. It requires a little more effort than just throwing the clothes in the washing machine and coming back in 30 minutes, but then it requires no coins or travel to the laundry mat, either. The unit seems well built and I expect it to pay for itself many times over. A good value.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Once we figured out how much water to put in it things worked alright...", "text": "We went from living on a third-floor apartment with laundry in the basement and across the building to a small duplex with free laundry. Unfortunately for us, the machines look like they are from the 1970s and have rust on all the lint wires, etc. So we ended up getting this machine for some smaller loads. To be honest, I don't know how long it will last, but when it works, it works great!<br /><br />Our first load was a disaster, the directions are awful and we actually appear to have put more water in than needed because water was leaking out the top sides of the bin.  We contacted customer service who wanted us to mail it back!  Right, because anyone is really going to pay a crap load of money out of their own pocket to return something this size!  No way. We decided to give it another try or two.  The second time I put less water in and thank goodness the leaking stopped.  It's a fine balance with this machine, finding the right amount of clothing/water to put in.  It does work better than I imagined it would, and we've been able to do good size loads. If it lasts, it will be well worth the 100.00 we paid.  If it mucks up in the next few weeks then we're better off at the laundry mat... This is a manual drain machine so it isn't easy. You may be dumping buckets of water down the tub drain like I am but for us it's worth it knowing we are washing our clothing in a machine that isn't 50 years old and only has our stuff in it!<br /><br />Okay, since the directions are awful, I'll give you a quick rundown of what they say to do here:<br /><br />1) Make sure spin dial is on soft or normal<br />2) put in detergent<br />3) Fill tub with water<br />4) add clothes<br />5) Close lid and turn time dial on for however long you want to wash them for<br />6) When load is done, turn dial to drain and drain water out of washer<br />7) Place clothing in spin dry machine and spin dry them for however long you'd like<br />8) Turn dial back to soft/normal<br />9) Fill tub in washer again with water (NO detergent)<br />10) Place clothing from spin dryer back in washing tub w/fresh water<br />11) Close lid and turn dial on for however long you want to rinse-wash your clothes<br />12) When done, drain<br />13) Place clothing in spin dryer and spin dry<br /><br />This is how I do it:<br /><br />1) Make sure spin dial is on soft or normal<br />2) put in detergent<br />3) Fill tub with water<br />4) add clothes<br />5) Close lid and turn time dial on for however long you want to wash them for<br />6) When load is done, turn dial to drain and drain water out of washer<br />7) Fill tub in washer again with water (NO detergent, but keep your wet clothing in)<br />8) Close lid and turn dial on for however long you want to rinse-wash your clothes<br />9) When done, drain<br />12) Place clothing in spin dryer and spin dry", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AHQTE5IT5EDPX6XFAUFURHBMCFSQ", "timestamp": 1462480258000, "helpful_vote": 1046, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Wonderful", "text": "I live in a very small apartment and have to carry laundry up and down stairs. I find this machine to be a big improvement.<br />I was very doubtful about this machine when I opened the box--it looks like a toy for my granddaughter, but IT WORKS WELL. I store it in my pantry and set it up in my bathtub. It is a little awkward to pick up and carry (I thinks it's 28 pounds, empty) but it's doable.<br />I'm not going to repeat all the positive reviews before mine, but I will say this: temper your expectations. You can't wash quilts or rugs, but the Giantex handles double bed sheets and jeans. This is not made for a family of four.<br />The drain hose and the electric cord are both short. A visit to your local hardware store can remedy that. You will need to buy a connector to attach the water hose to your chosen water source but that is only a few bucks; I advise a heavy-duty appliance extension cord since you'll be using it around water. When I do laundry, I put a thick rubber mat down in the bathtub (to stop the machine from 'traveling') and attach the water hose to the shower head.<br />The spinner leaves even heavy items, like towels and jeans, almost dry. If you don't like to iron items like shirts, reduce the spin time, shake the item and smooth it with your hands when you hang it up.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "More powerful than it looks!", "text": "This is my 3rd apartment washer in about 4 yrs, the motors tend to wear out easy. This is by far the most powerful and easiest machine I have had yet! The spin cycle doesn't look like it would do much, but most light weight fabrics will come out almost dry! Hang it for a couple hours and its done! The instruction booklet that comes with it is very poorly translated, and wont give you much info, but it is good for a giggle! My recommendation is to watch one of the review videos or look it up on YouTube, there are tons of videos explaining how to use it. I have found you need very little soap, and you really don't need to run an extra rinse cycle if you ring out the cloths a little before putting them in the spinner, then run some water in for about a minute or so before starting the spin cycle. Everything has washed and rinsed very clean and doesn't use much water at all. Like most reviews here, I don't use the provided hose for filling it up. I have it set up next to my bathtub and use the shower wand. The only problem I've encountered was that the drain hose was on the opposite side from the bathtub, but I just got a bucket to drain it into. You could easily get some extension tubing to remedy this as well. Over all, I believe it is well worth the price if you have very little space and are tired of using the laundromat or the 50 yr old machines provided by your apartment complex. For $100 even of it only lasts a year, it has more than paid for itself.", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AFXWPYINRIM7C7QHLZLI3L3AGD2A", "timestamp": 1517690317260, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

There is only one hose provided and it is made of cheap plastic with no threads or fittings. The water inlets are also without threads, so a tube with exact fitting rubber gaskets would be necessary.<br />After hanging to dry, I often have to use a lint brush or roller to get lint/hair off the clothes.

This is a great little washer for apartment living. Gets clothes really clean. The only down side is the draining of the water, you either have to have the washer on a stand so the water just flows out the hose ( by gravity) and into the tub or bucket. Or what I did is put the washer in the tub with a non slip mat under it (so it wouldn\u2019t shake around) and I also got a rubber tub stopper, made a hole in the middle of it ( big enough for the hose to fit into, but snug) and put it around the end of the hose that way the part where the water comes out fits perfectly into the tub drain and it won\u2019t wet the bottom of the washer (and won\u2019t cause a mess).

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great for Camper/RV life folks!", "text": "I bought this in February of 2017. It is the BEST investment I made. It is labor intensive but not as much as taking clothes down to the river and beating them against the rocks. We bought a 24-ft camper for us to live in. The problem there is that small campers don't generally have washers and dryers. I was against spending hard earned money on change for a big washer so I bought this.<br /><br />There were a few things I noticed though, so I'll offer a few tips that I managed to work out, in no particular order.<br /><br />* We don't need to hook up hoses or anything, the way we do it, except the drain hose, which I just let loose into the tub. We just lower the hose and put it in our tub. I just use the detachable shower head to fill it up and run it.<br />* Because it's so small, be prepared to have to wash them twice at times. However, see note on soaking next.<br />* I found that soaking clothes for about 20 minutes before washing really helped to remove a lot of dirt. We live in a sandy, windy, dusty dirt area so our clothes, for whatever reason, really absorbs dirt. lol! It's that or with my regular washer in my house (my kids keep the house), I never saw the dirt so had no idea how dirty they really were.<br />* If you use it in the tub/shower the way I do, then be sure to rinse the spinner after spinning with soap in the clothing, else you add soap back to the clothes after the rinse. That is wash clothes &#62; spin &#62; rinse spinner &#62; rinse clothes in washer &#62; spin again.<br />* I would NOT put King sheets in this. In order to wash our Queen-sized sheets well enough to be clean, I can only wash one sheet at a time.<br />* I use fabric softener and I use about a quarter, or slightly less, of what is recommend for regular laundry. Be careful though because certain colors may turn the color of the softener. Test it first on something white that you don't care about, if possible.<br />* I've used bleach in this too, though a lot of RV folks are anti-bleach. I use about 1/4 c. but start with much less for yourselves. I rinse it twice, when using bleach. You may want to try a third rinse too.<br />* As for laundry detergent, if it has levels for a small load, use a little less than that, otherwise, I'd just about 1/4 to 1/8 of what a normal load would be. It really all depends how difficult it is to get the soap out. If you notice that the rinse water still feels soapy, then you need to reduce how much you use. It's easy though to fix, simply rinse until it's not bubbly anymore.<br />* This is good for about two adults. I saw a review for a woman who has a child but there was no way I could do with only this washer when my kids were small. I don't recommend it but if you're pushed and determined, you could get away with it.<br />* For RV users,  [[ASIN:B01LZYLO2A I use this]] to dry clothes both indoors and outdoors, depending on the weather. I hook it to a kitchen cabinet handle and the bathroom door handle and it works great. It doesn't provide to much heaviness to damage either handle. The con is that it runs right down the center of the camper and is seriously in the way. I got to where I began washing clothes, linens, etc., daily and hang them at night, just before bed. They're dry by morning. You can buy more clothes pins but I overlap everything to maximize clip usage. You can even just throw it over the thing. Oh, one more con is that it does sink. I learned that I put the heaviest stuff near where the hooks are at the ends, then the light stuff in the middle. We have [[ASIN:B010OTUA9M this too]] but I hate it. It looks like it has a newer model now though, which may help. The other never balanced correctly and the clips fall off and so on. It was more annoying than anything.<br /><br />Phew! Anyway, as you can see I've used it for a long time and I am aware of issues and problems. I've now shared that with all of you so you can have a good experience. Hopefully this helps. I highly recommend this!

Automatic washer machines or ones you don't have to modify are four or five star machines, not this one. It's a good little machine, but it has some flaws. The filler hose is incredibly small. You have to hold it against the sink. After some time the hose will slip out of the cap. So using a bucket to fill it is better and much faster. The other flaw (and I knew this going in) is that the machine needs to be elevated above the drain hose or at the same level (placing in a bath tub, for example) for it to drain properly. You can drain it into a bucket, but you have babysit it as it does so. What I did not expect is for the drainage hose to be so short. The only way I can effectively use this machine until I modify it is to put it in the bath tub. I don't understand why it couldn't have been designed with and shipped with a stand to elevate it another 4-6 inches and keep it stable. There is no notification that the cycles are done except that the machine goes quiet. So unless you aren't playing music, watching TV or whatever, you won't know it's done. So one has to sort of babysit it. The directions are awful and written in broken english, though the machine is simple to use. Unless you want to do some work on this machine I'd look for another one.

This is what I have learned in that time.<br />Do not add detergent to the laundry on its first time in the washer, you will be amazed at how much soap is left in your things using a regular washer.<br />I use vinegar and ammonia (1/4 cup of each) on my laundry, occasionally some bleach or Oxyclean . Less expensive, totally cleans and no perfumy smell. In this time I have bought only one large bottle of each. Go easy on the bleach, it takes way less than you're used to using.<br />Thing that takes the longest for me is filling it up and I am going to try and remedy that soon.<br />Clean the lint trap before your first load....<br /><br />If you find a white residue on your clothes after they dry ? It is soap, wash that item alone using the vinegar etc.......and HOT WATER. The hot water loosens the weave in the clothing and allows all the soap to get out.<br /><br />I am single so it is mostly office style clothing with some tshirts, so far so good.<br />I DO NOT USE THE SPINNER FOR MY CLOTHES........... I hang them to drip dry, otherwise they are too wrinkled to wear and I hate to iron .<br />I use the spinner for underwear, towels, sheets etc only.<br />I bought lingerie bags to wash bras etc, it was was unnecessary. Use the soft cycle and since there is no agitator, they just roll and spin in the water.<br />Once I am finished washing, I  leave the lids up and let it dry out completely before shutting them and covering it. I have it in my kitchen in front of a window and I really don't want to look at it all the time :)<br /><br />I FREAKING LOVE THIS THING !!!!!!!!!!!!!

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great little washer", "text": "Bought this in July 2016 and it is still performing well.  The agitator is tough on clothes so I do not recommend this machine for delicate items.  Pants and long sleeved shirts become tangled with other clothing.  I use shaving cream for my spot remover and then wash clothing as usual and everything is spectacularly clean.<br /><br />I usually wash spin dry then rinse and spin dry.  Today I tried washing then adding water to the spin dry side while the clothes were spinning. The two water inlets add water to the washing tub or spin tub.  The inlets are not for hot and cold water.<br /><br />This little machine is great for cleaning regular somewhat hardy clothes and sheets or towels.<br /><br />Take time to load the spinner tub carefully.  I fold up towels, pants, shirts, and dresses.  I add them to the tub. Leave the lids open and set the timer. Close the lid, ready to quickly open the lid if it is off balance.  The ring on top of the tub has dislodged many times.  I just re position and/or lighten the load.  Push the ring back on the top of the tub and attempt the spin dry again.  The first time it dislodged I thought I broke the spin dryer.  I took a deep breath and examined the tub and noticed that the ring and tub seemed undamaged.  I positioned the ring over the tub and pushed down til I felt the ring positioning down onto the top of the tub.  I attempted spin drying and it worked flawlessly.<br /><br />I have a garden hose with a cone shaped spray nozzle that I use for the water application.  I just push the tip into the water inlet and start the water and the water flows into the machine.<br /><br />I highly recommend this item to someone who lives in an apartment and just wants an inexpensive washing machine.  This machine must be placed so that the drain hose is lower than the machine.  So if you do not have a tub or shower area that will accommodate its size, you will need to find a way to raise it high enough to accommodate a bucket.<br /><br />Wish you the best.", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AE7QB5ZH3VXAN6TOGJ64Q4HV2KQQ", "timestamp": 1478978366000, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Damn good money spent. Would definitely buy again.", "text": "This machine is really freeking good for the price. This washer/spin dry combo kicks my expensive home washer into the dirt! I bought this machine at first for my camper, for when my husband and I are out on the road for work. Some places are just really dirty for a place meant to get clothes clean. So we started looking into some small washer that could save us some money and exposure to whatever is in those machines at the poorly mantained public laundromats. We we're looking at stackables when we stumbled onto this one. I admit, I didn't expect much. Boy was I glad to be wrong! I use it all the time now. It cleans so well I have taken it over to my in-laws to show them! They RV too, and didn't expect this machine to take \"clean\" clothes that had gone through their expensive, brand name washer, and clean even more soil out of them! Nice! I have been using the machine since April, and it's now December. Still running strong, and still my primary washing machine. It has gotten a bit loud, so I am not sure of the longevity of the motor. It's the only reason I am not giving this unit five stars. It's gotten quite loud. I tried to open it up to see if it just needed a bit of oil/grease. (I have a background in electronics repair, honestly don't even attempt it.) It's a sealed bearing unit, so no go. This doesn't really put me off too much. I have saved money using this machine.  When the motor says enough, I will definitely be purchasing another unit. The drier is a belt driven centrifuge in a separate compartment. So you can start another load in the washer while \"drying\". I really like this. I also got a laugh out of the instructions. The print is tiny! So, so small! The translation is far from helpful, you end up with more questions than answers. I also noticed a lot of people trying way too hard to come up with plumbing for this very simple process. Don't waste your money on hoses and cuplers. Here is my solution:<br /><br />*Place the unit into your tub/shower stall. (I used a plastic stress mat to elevate the machine from the water draning into the stall/tub. It really helps with the noise from the motor as well)<br /><br />*Take down the drain hose from the machine, point that toward the drain of your tub/shower stall.<br /><br />*Use your existing shower hose and head to fill the washer. (Just drop the thing right into the washer compartment and fill. No need for special plumbing or any extra cost to you. I feel like everyone is trying to over engineer this problem. I love some of the solutions people have some up with, but this hack is really simple and free.)<br /><br />So the water gravity drains. When you are finished with your wash/spin dry, you will want to pick up the unit and tip it toward the hose to get the rest of the water out of the machine. The centrifuge drier does a pretty good job at wringing the excess water out of the clothing. Hang dry overnight will work for even thick jeans or a Carhartt jacket. The clothing will be a bit stiff, but they will be clean and dry. If you hate the stiffness, you can use the washer and go to the laundrymat to dry and still save money. I find the lint catcher does a good enough job that adding a second one that floats in with the wash to be unnecessary. I have already saved enough money from not going to the laundrymat to have bought this washer several times over. I would absolutely recommend it, and if this one gives up the ghost, I'm buying another.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Good for single-person household", "text": "I'm just one person, and I do about three loads a week, because it doesn't hold a lot of clothes.  But I'm guessing that an average-sized family would find that they'd be doing laundry almost every day with this relatively small washer.  I'm not sure about the long-term reliability yet, as I've had it for only a few months.  But I have some tips for those who are considering buying this item or who have already bought it.<br /><br />First, as others have said, the intake hose that comes with it is inadequate.  I went to Home Depot and bought a 10-foot length of clear, braided, 5/8-inch inside diameter tubing, as well as some fittings to allow me to connect it to my sink faucet.  If you want to do this, first unscrew the faucet aerator and take it w/you to the store so they can match the thread.  Don't get plain clear tubing; make sure you get the braided tubing that has reinforcing thread spiraling around the tubing.  Regular unbraided tubing will soften too much when using hot water, and will tend to kink.  The braiding keeps it from kinking and cutting off the water supply.<br /><br />I also leave the washer lid open, fully upright, when filling w/the hose connected to the nipple that sticks up behind the tank.  This takes stress off the nipple and keeps it from cracking/breaking by having the hose come straight down, supported by the open lid, instead of having sideways tension on the filling nipple.<br /><br />Secondly, if you put this next to the bathtub on a raised platform/bench so that it can drain into the tub via gravity, make sure the supporting item is really solid and won't flex (i.e., do NOT use plastic milk crates, etc., as they are too flexible and will allow the machine to sway from side to side.  I think a really solid wood or metal bench would work fine as long as it is high enough for the gravity drain to work (there's no electric pump to lift water up).  But I finally just put the washer up on my granite countertop in the kitchen, so it drains into the kitchen sink.  I put a cheap rubber door mat under the washer's feet.  This gives it a solid footing, and keeps noise/vibration to a minimum, and also protects the granite counter top.<br /><br />Also, be aware that most clothing will tangle horribly and get all knotted up during a typical 15-minute wash cycle, especially items such as long-sleeved shirts/long sleeved t-shirts, long pants, etc., and this will cause the items not to get as clean as possible.  To avoid this problem you can get some medium-sized mesh washer bags.  These are about 12\" x \"16\" and several will fit properly in the washer tank.  Larger ones will probably get jammed up in there, I think.  But after trying mesh washer bags, I have opted to just untangle the clothing between wash and rinse cycles.  Washing smaller items together in one load, such as socks, short-sleeved t-shirts and underpants, results in little or no tangling.<br /><br />Really large items such as a full-bed blanket, etc., can be washed, but should be washed alone because they are so big.  They will be too large to put into the spin dryer, so you can just use a portable drying rack.  I stick my drying rack in the bathtub and drip-dry such large items; then I am able to dry them in my portable clothes dryer, once they are just damp but no longer dripping.<br />A few people here have noted that they are concerned about mold/mildew building up in the washer\u2019s plumbing, but I haven\u2019t detected any problem after several months.  I leave the washer and spinner lids open and the drain valve open for about 24 hours after using, so it dries out well.  If you\u2019re still worried, you can always put a half cup of white vinegar in a half-full washer and swish it around for a few seconds, then drain the unit.  The vinegar solution will kill anything that might otherwise grow there between loads, and will leave a mildew-resistant film on the parts.<br /><br />https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B071L6QPXF/ref=psdc_3744371_t3_B071HM1TKK<br /><br />https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00H7P1GPO/ref=psdc_695488011_t1_B001UE8ILI<br /><br />https://smile.amazon.com/Kasydoff-Portable-Foldable-Clothing-Automatic/dp/B07CNGJFX1/ref=sr_1_3?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1534786665&sr=1-3&keywords=Kasydoff+Portable+Clothes+Dryer&dpID=51HElumSF2L&preST=_SY300_QL70_&dpSrc=srch<br /><br />EDIT:  I have now been using this machine for many months, and it seems very reliable.  NOTE:  be careful not to fill the spin dryer too full.  Leave a few inches between the top of the clothes and the ring around the top of the spin cylinder.  If you do get it too full, the force will knock off the ring that sits at the top of the spinner cylinder, and it creates a terrible noise.  It's not broken, but you can't use the spinner again until you put the ring back on top and seat it down properly again.<br /><br /> To do this, lay the ring on the top and put a long, solid object (e.g., a metal ruler, flathead screwdriver using the flat side) on top across it.  Then go around the top ring gently tapping the long object near the ring as you go.  It may take two trips around to get the entire ring seated snugly again.  Tapping will bring it down about a half inch, where it should sit solidly again.  Just make sure it is seated completely all the way around.", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AFXXMNSD73YEDORU7YLJVZV6PESQ", "timestamp": 1553910529791, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": true}

I was worried it would be too small and not get clothes clean.  I have been hand washing my own clothes but now that I am doing my 9 year old grandsons clothes I need to have something more powerful.  Last night we put 10 white uniform shirts of his in the machine (think dirty, he's 9). I was surprised at how strong the agitator was and how clean the clothes were.  They looked like new. A little bit of lint was on the clothes but once they dried it wiped right off. It took me three spins to  spin all the shirts. I hung them to dry on a hanger and he wore one to school this morning. It looked like a brand new shirt.  I really did not think the spinner would work that well.  The directions that come with it are a bit hard to read (poor translation) but I think I figured it out. I haven't figured out when I would put water in the spinner though, any clues?  I wish I would have bought this years ago, no more afternoons at the laundromat, now we can keep up with laundry by doing a bit every night.  I have not tried towels yet.  I can fit sheets but probably not a blanket.<br /><br />Just wanted to update that after 6.5 years my washer that I originally paid 85 dollars for finally gave out.  What a bargain!

Due to health problems the laundry mat is difficult for me to use. I researched these mini washers for 2 months. Delivery was easy. Delivered to my door. I picked up the box containing the washer with both hands ready to heave it up the stairs. I got a grip on the top of the box with one hand on the shipping strap. I then carried the box into my trailer easily! LIghter than expected. My back was pleased.  My mind wondered if something so light would be any good.  After reading reviews, I expected to pour in the water due to the hose not fitting my faucets. I got a piece of gray  pipe insulation &  cut to length. I  opened slightly and held one end under the faucet. The other end I hold over the washer.The cut in the insulation with the yellow plastic over the gluey cut allowed me to watch and control water flow at the faucet.  I left the yellow plastic on the insulation pipe cover.  It fills up the washer tub nicely with out a bucket. My clothes come out so much cleaner than when laundered at the public laundries<br />  The washer holds more than I expected. Trial and error. Today it was Queen size sheets and 3 pillow cases fit fine. The lint catcher is easy to use if you gently press down on the top latch, invert the bag to empty it. Once I located and figured out how to empty the lint catcher did I realize I could fill the washer with more clothes and water than I had been putting in the washer.  Only about half the washer load fits is the spin dryer. Patience I will use as I am at home, other things to do while I spin twice for 1 wash load..The spin dryer gets more water out of the clothes than the public laundries washers.. There are drain slots between the 2 tubs to catch water drippings as you load from one to another.<br />  Draining the water...simple enough except for operator error. Remember to turn it on and off as needed for washer use. I have my washer on a dollie that is 5 1/2 inches high. This makes the gravity drain from the washer a hair higher than a dish tub ( the type you wash dishes in when camping) .I hold the hose while it drains into the tub. Any mess was from me filling the dish tub  too high or tipping the tub as I lift it to the sink. A mop or towel fixed that fast.  A few times I forgot  to turn off the drain knob and over filled the tub.  Practice will improve that. It looks like a cheap washer. Well it is!  But.....

I've moved my rating from 5 stars to 2 because it worked great at first, however,  6 months on it's money down the drain.<br />*******<br /><br />We bought this for our daughter who is in an older campus apartment. There are washers and dryers on each floor but not one in her unit. This little w/d is so portable and it takes a load to work out what is best for you.<br />My daughter was ready to just give up after the first try. However, it was late, we were tired so I just let it be. The next morning, I woke up and started a load. One of the frustrations was that the water intake tube didn't fit on the faucet. My solution (and a quicker one at that!) was that I filled up the bucket that I was going to drain into and poured that into the wash basin. Much quicker. Then to drain it.<br />I did a wash and a rinse - something I don't see other people doing - but I drained as much as possible and put in rinse water and drained. I moved it over in batches to spin. Most of the clothes spun to just damp. I then hung everything out on her balcony on the drying racks. Drained the tub completely and then put it up!<br />She watched me do it all. I told her that it takes less effort than dragging her things down the hallway (clothes, detergent, fabric beads etc) and then running back and forth waiting to see if things were done and worrying about if they would get stolen. Since I left her 4 days ago, she's already done 3 loads:)<br />I saw a video saying it could take up to 17 pounds of clothes, but I think smaller batches are best.

We have a dedicated one in our apartment complex, but it was still such a hassle to have to lug the laundry downstairs and two buildings over, and make that trip at least three times to do a load of laundry.  Combined with the competition of trying to get a washing machine or dryer in the first place, it was just such a headache.<br /><br />I was hesitant about buying an &#34;apartment sized&#34; washer, but I have to say I'm really happy with this little guy.  Sure, it would be nice if it had an incorporated spin cycle, and was a little larger, but you have to pay more for those things and I wasn't willing to.  Maybe in the future I'll upgrade to something that &#34;does it all&#34;, but right now I have me, my wife and our two young kids, and this unit is enough to keep up with that if we don't get lazy about it.<br /><br />I recommend this for anyone who doesn't mind keeping an eye on their laundry process.  The separate spin cycle is a little annoying, especially since it's not big enough to do the entire load you just washed.  You end up doing two separate spin cycles, but like I said, you pay to get convenience.  If set it and forget it is important to you, spring for the $350 versions that are all in one.<br /><br />Note:  As you've probably read on other reviews, the hose for filling up the unit with water is useless.  I use this machine in my tub, and I have a hand-held shower head that I just drop in the wash basin and turn on to fill.  The unit is gravity drain, and if you use the little hook on the drain hose to keep it pointed into the drain, all the water goes right into the drain without any problems.  You have to lift the unit up at the end to get out the residual water before removing the hose, but that's not too bad.  I also recommend getting a mat or something if you're putting it on a hard floor to keep it from &#34;walking around&#34;.<br /><br />All in all, I have absolutely no complaints based on what I paid for this.  Sure, there are things I wish were more convenient, but at $100, I can't seriously complain about the small things.  I just included them so you'd know.<br /><br />Awesome product!", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AFMOWKG3Q74UFSWZJZAVLJY6EDXA", "timestamp": 1481145538000, "helpful_vote": 22, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "although it can still be picked up and moved quite easily. For me", "text": "Rather than continually use the coin laundry machine in my apartment, I bought this to give it a go.<br /><br />As the videos show, it's actually somewhat sizeable, although it can still be picked up and moved quite easily. For me, the size is enough to pick up a 'regular size' load consisting of either 14-24 pairs of underwear or 10 or so t-shirts.<br /><br />In terms of ease of use, this can use some improvement at least as far as filling goes. The included fill tube is just that- a tube, and you have to find a way to adapt it to a hose (As you can see in other reviews, people have come up with all kinds of methods to secure it to a faucet). Emptying is not as annoying because the empty tube has a hook so you can leave it upright when not in use; and it's fairly substantial so it can be dumped into a drain. However, because you have to manually fill and empty it, it can get pretty messy in an apartment. Eventually, I took the easiest/laziest way of using this, opting to put the whole thing in my shower so that I can fill it directly with the showerhead and empty it directly into the drain.<br /><br />In terms of actual usage, the performance of this machine is pretty surprising. As long as you manage how much you're loading it by, it does a pretty good job washing everything. For example, a pair of dirty pants from a day of hiking through the mud was completely clean by the end of a simple 10 minute cycle. A few complaints: the machine isn't quiet by modern standards (though not deafening), and if you do happen to heavily load it, I did notice a metallic smell from the motor that indicates that it's working hard. After 40 washes though, no issues.<br /><br />The spin-dry function is also very surprising. Again, if you manage your loads, most of your clothes come out to almost completely dry with a &#60; 2 minute cycle. One of the most frequently washed items for me are Ex-officio, Calvin Klein Micro material type of quick-dry underwear, and usually after a 2-minute spin cycle they come out essentially already dry. Even things like heavy jeans (provided you place only one or two of them in at a time) come out relatively dry and only need a few hours hung dry, saving substantial amounts of time. You *can* overload the spin-dry, but it would be pretty obvious as the rotation speeds would end up very slow and the machine would vibrate from the imbalance- make sure you distribute your clothing evenly around the tumbler and you're good.<br /><br />Overall, the convenience of being able to wash the laundry in a regular apartment without having to use coin laundry cannot be understated, and while it can be a bit clumsy to use, the machine does an excellent job actually washing laundry. And at this price point, it doesnt' even take long to recoup the cost of buying the machine vs. using coin laundry. If the company can improve the filling mechanism to be more faucet friendly, this would get 5 stars!", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AG3PNQCDKO5LC2JJSITZMBKDLGBQ", "timestamp": 1514569242172, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Giantex (Costway) Portable Washing Machine 17.6 lbs.", "text": "Washes and spin dries clothes very well.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Separate belt drive motor for the washer and direct drive motor for the spin dryer<br />2. The 'drain' function is only for the washer.  This means you can use the spin dryer without draining the washer. You can reuse the wash water several times if you're off grid and water is limited<br />3. Very light weight compared to full sized washers<br />4. Washer and spin dryer is a big enough for most items except comforters and large bulky, heavy items.<br />5. Virtually no mess moving clothes from the washer to the dryer and there's no need to squeeze the water out before putting clothes into the spin dryer<br />6. More energy efficient and effective at spin drying than full sized washers.<br />7. About 90% of the water is removed if you spin dry until no more water comes out (3 - 5 minutes)<br />8. In my electric dryer, clothes are dry in 1/4 of the time<br />9. Two wash settings. (I always use 'soft' because it's easier on the machine and the clothes.)<br />10. Uses very little water and soap.  (I use a teaspoon of liquid soup for 3 gallons of water and do several loads with the same water if clothes are lightly soiled.  Pretreat heavily soiled areas with spot remover first.)<br />11. You can rinse your clothes during the spin dry cycle without opening the door.  (I spin dry the wash water out. Then I  add rinse water to the dryer inlet with a funnel while the spin dryer is still spinning. )<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Cheap, thin plastic case, hoses, and controls. Functional and solid enough but requires you to be gentle<br />2. Quiet mechanically but even minor vibrations can cause the case to rattle and make noise<br />3. Washing and spin drying takes more time and is more labor intensive than a fully automatic machine mostly because of the machine's relatively small capacity<br />4. Light duty but plenty strong enough if you clean a few items at a time and don't overload the machine<br />5. If you don't use enough water, some clothes will curl up in a ball and not wash well. (You need a bare minimum of 2 gallons but the water can be used several times if you wash lightly soiled clothes first and heavily soiled clothes last. Jeans and heavy bath towels will need a minimum of 3 gallons each and more would be better.)<br />6. Ideally the machine should be elevated a couple feet so you can see when the water is done coming out of the hose during the spin cycle. However I have used it on the shower floor.<br />7. To drain all the water out you really need to tilt the machine several times from one side to the other.  If you don't do that and don't use the machine for several days, I would expect mold and mildew to grow.<br /><br />I have a full sized automatic washer and dryer. I bought this for off grid, boon docking, and camping. For the past two weeks I've done all my clothes, bedding, and towels in this little machine.  I know it does a better job because it agitates better and removes much more water which means more dirt and soap is removed and drying time is incredibly fast. A full laundry basket typically dries in 10 to 15 minutes (in my dryer) compared to 40 minutes to an hour. I only wash a few items at a time and wash every 2 - 3 days so it takes longer. Also I use buckets to fill and empty the machine. Not bad though. I use 3 gallons of wash water and 1 gallon of rinse to do 3 days worth of laundry.  It takes time but I do other things while the machine is working.  Next month I'll be using it off grid with a generator.<br /><br />I would recommend this machine for apartments, individuals and couples without full sized machines, RV's, off grid, and people who want to save money on energy. That being said, everything except the metal electric motors look very cheap. Not sure how long the machine will last but if you're mechanically inclined it looks like it would be easy to get the machine working again. If you remove the back cover, you'll see how simple the machine is. I like the design. The simple mechanical controls are connected to strings that operate switches and valves.  No printed circuit boards to burn up that I could see.", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AGHC2ZLQYEH5COB555ZSCNUTLDKQ", "timestamp": 1548251949457, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Will NEVER own a traditional washer and dryer again.", "text": "5/21 Update, down from 4 stars. Sigh, the Assurant warranty plan won't 'kick' in as it's still under manufacturer's warranty. Guess who will not respond.<br /><br />5/10 Still love the machine BUT guess what the motor has died (and after I just left an update barely a month ago. TSK TSK TSK). I turn it on and can hear the timer ticking away but it will not spin.  Reached out to Assurant, as it is clearly beyond the 30-day window. The price has gone up since I purchased, but still within the insurance plan range. I fully expect them to let me simply order a replacement, but we shall see. If they don't I shall order another one and throw down with the insurance company.  Like I said still love the machine, still think it's worth the money and deserves four stars, just go ahead and spend the extra $16 for the 3-year insurance plan.<br /><br />4/7 Update:<br />OMG, okay since I spent the first 8 months using with a garden hose I never realized what the purpose of the two intake areas was for. I naively thought you attached the hose to whichever side was closest to your faucet. Nope. The one on the washer side is to fill the tub, the one on the spinner side shoots water into there. This means that you can spin rinse. Thus cutting down on the number of times I have to spin thus decreasing the amount of time I spend doing laundry. It's ridiculous how excited this makes me.<br /><br />Original Review Below<br /><br />Okay, first my dryer died. No biggie, I'm a country girl you know I had two old fashioned accordion clothes hangers so we kept right on trucking.  Then my washing machine died. SIGH! I'm not dedicated enough to wash in sink/tub. As significant other and I telecommute I guess we could go au natural, BUT my 6-year-old not really gonna be happy about that.  The washer died at the end of July 2018, I ordered this on August 2nd and had it within a week. To be honest the shipping box was a hot mess. Dang thing was so busted and torn we couldn't even get it into the house in the box, but the washer itself was fine.<br /><br />Today is April 3, 2019, so we have been using this for 8 months.  The directions are completely useless, not to mention so tiny who can read what is said, but set up is not complicated. Well, it wouldn't be IF the stupid intake hose had an adapter for the sink. That is VERY important for you to realize before you order this item. I had read enough reviews and seen some clever ideas on how to work around this that I was prepared. Not to mention this was not going inside our apartment but outside on the patio, where I used with a garden hose.  We bought a weatherproof tarp and covered when not in use. We were living in CO at the time. This bad girl survived the winter in the snow, rain, etc.  We have since moved to N.C. and putting her outside no longer an option; fortunately the new apartment has two full baths so we can use in the front bathroom tub no problem.<br /><br />This, of course, meant I needed to use the intake hose or a bucket to fill her up. Yeah, I did about 5 loads using the bucket method, and while it was nice to be able to use hot water as opposed to only cold with the garden hose, my back was not amused.<br /><br />So here is what I did. I purchased (all items off of Amazon) a shower converter, Blue Monster Pipe Sealant tape,  a plastic flex hose connector, and oh yeah I already had duct tape. I removed the shower head, slid on the converter (I wrapped some monster tape to help with any leaking, but as the shower is never used in this bathroom, the 6-year-old- takes a bath, I don't mind if a bit of water drips when in use) connected the flex hose to the converter, used a pair of scissors to cut off  the metal nut/bolt (I'm not a handy person I have no idea what it's really called) on the other end and then simply slid the connector hose about 6 inches into the intake hose. Wrapped some more monster tape (sorry forgot to take a photo of that) then covered that tape with the duct tape. Voila, I can now use the shower to fill up the washing machine.<br /><br />Please note that while in the photos the machine is NOT in the tub, I do put it into the tub when in use. Mainly because otherwise gravity will not drain it into the tub, the exit/drainage hose rises at too high of an angle, thus requiring that I drain into a bucket. Well hello, I'm trying to avoid buckets. I can pretty easily lift the empty washer in and out of the tub for usage.<br /><br />THAT being said, let's talk about this baby. Significant other and I are not tiny people. He's 6 foot and about 230 lbs, I'm 5'7 and about 295 lbs. I say this so that you can get an idea of how big our clothes are and how much this will do in a load. The Typhoon, aka 6-year-old normal skinny kid.  If I'm doing his clothes I can wash a week of colours in one load. He typically wears a shirt, pants and two pair of boxers (one to sleep a fresh pair to start the day) a day. The machine can handle that in one load easy peasy.<br /><br />If I'm doing S.O. and my laundry, well that is a bit different. Typically I can do about 5 of our shirts (think t-shirt) 2 pairs of either his or my shorts per load. If long pants are involved it depends. I mainly wear leggings so I can usually do 3 shirts and 3 leggings at a time. His pants are more like track pants and I can usually do 3 shirts and 2 pants. If jeans are involved I only do 1 pair of his jeans with 3 shirts.<br /><br />One thing I really like is this has a soft (in my head gentle) setting. I use that for all my underwire bras and knickers.  Again I'm a big gal so the unmentionables tend to be washed as their own load. My bras are a 44/46 DD with underwire. I can usually do 3 or 4 with 5 to 6 knickers in a load. I do put them in mesh bags, but I'd do that in a traditional washer. If I'm not washing bras I can throw in S.O. boxer briefs from the week with all my knickers in one load.<br /><br />All of these I use the large load water line setting (FYI it's on the inside of the washer to back right. There is an S line, M line, and L line).<br /><br />I have washed two bath sheets and three wash clothes as a load; 1 bath towel with about 7 dish towels as a load; and I typically take everyone's socks for the week and wash them as their own load. I have also washed as a load a twin fitted sheet and a twin thin fleece blanket as a load. Our bed is a queen and I can wash the fitted sheet with two pillowcases and the flat sheet with the other two pillowcases as a load.<br /><br />I don't really measure the amount of liquid detergent I use, I'd guess maybe a quarter of the laundry cap. Fabric softener depending on items anywhere from a quarter to 1/2 a cap. I personally put the laundry detergent and fabric softener in first, start the water running to activate them and then put the clothes. I make sure all the clothes are wet before starting the machine. I just think it doesn't make the machine work as hard to get the cycle going if everything is already wet.  If you do NOT see a whirlpool suction in the middle when it is churning, you have overloaded and you need to remove some items.<br /><br />I typically wash for 15 minutes. Drain.  Spin. You will need to do at least two spin dry cycles (sometimes three depending on the size of clothing). I then toss everything back into the washer and fill it up again with water to rinse. Why do I spin in between cycles you may ask. I personally found if I didn't then the detergent and fabric softener weren't rinsing out as well as I liked, by spinning them before the rinse it sort helps jump-start that process. I typically spin for about 90 seconds or until I no longer see water draining.  Please note that you can fill up the washer machine as you are spinning clothes, this helps speed up the process.<br /><br />For the rinse, I typically do for 9 minutes. If I am busy doing something else I'll do for 15 minutes just for the heck of it but I find 9 works well for me. I thin spin them dry again, the same process about 90 seconds per batch, until no more water is being wrung from them. Then hang them up on my handy dandy accordion clothes dryer.  In CO I would just leave outside to dry until I had time to fold and put away so never really noticed how long it took to dry. Here in N.C. since they are inside I turn my fan on them as they are drying and typically I'd say anywhere from 30 - 90 minutes (again depending on what was washed) they are dry. Plus since the fan is blowing on them, the fresh smell from the fabric softener is dispersed throughout my house, you'd swear I had been cleaning as well as doing laundry.<br /><br />We love the money we save on electricity by not using a traditional washer and dryer. To be fair both S.O. and I have white collared jobs so it's not like the washer is being asked to do serious cleaning for someone who does hard manual labor. But the Typhoon has rolled around in some serious mud puddles and this thing has cleaned his clothes INCLUDING his tennis shoes with no issue.  I am very pleased when I see the dirty water drain out, I know that the clothes are getting clean.<br /><br />OH!!! Please note you will need a lint brush. You never realize how much lint a traditional dryer removes from your clothes until you no longer have one. I have two cats so all my clothes tend to be covered in cat hair to boot. I've tried some of the gadgets I've seen for portable washers to eliminate the lint, but have yet to find anything satisfactory.<br /><br />For quilts and heavier blankets we just take those to the complex's laundry room and wash there. That's about the only real drawback, but not enough to make me regret the purchase.<br /><br />The machine itself is simple enough to use, even Typhoon has done some of his own laundry.  I liked it so much that in January I bought one for my mother, who had failed to tell me that she had been doing her laundry by hand for months or paying to have someone do at her local laundry mat.<br /><br />I had a video of both Typhoon and me doing laundry but I couldn't get the video off the phone to upload on the website. Shoot.<br /><br />Now since I love it so much you may wonder why not 5 stars. I docked a star for the HORRIBLE intake hose that will not fit any US sink that I have ever encounter. It would have been nice in the description for them to mention that if you wanted to use a faucet you would need to make some additional purchases. That just annoyed me, but now hopefully, if you have read all of this then you know what else you will need.<br /><br />In total with all the additional parts I paid less than $130 price a traditional washer and dryer and that price right there is golden. I am a Prime Member so I did not pay to ship on anything I ordered.  I was a bit nervous about it breaking so to be safe I did purchase the 3-year appliance protection plan, haven't had to use it and hopefully won't need to, but I didn't want something to go kerplunk after the 30-day return window closed. Nor did I want the seller to disappear. This way my mind was at ease.  It's been 8 months and I'm happy as can be.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61P2qgcL2yL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61P2qgcL2yL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61P2qgcL2yL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61QwgUkrpwL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61QwgUkrpwL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61QwgUkrpwL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Xe9pCOLiL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Xe9pCOLiL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Xe9pCOLiL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61dsMsJw2OL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61dsMsJw2OL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61dsMsJw2OL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61sS3vXpovL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61sS3vXpovL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61sS3vXpovL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AFFN75OI2OYO6VPPD23PMVTTGA7A", "timestamp": 1554320216405, "helpful_vote": 162, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Hey not bad!", "text": "My motivations for looking for a portable washer: I needed to give in and just make laundry more convenient by being able to do it in my apartment, huge industrial washers rough up my clothes, I had just ordered a bunch of very prissy workout clothes that needed cold and gentle washing and air drying, was sick of watching my laundry basket overflow and have to do a bunch of laundry at once \u2026list goes on.<br /><br />I live in a 350 sq ft apartment and honestly this is a little big. Also, as you\u2019ll see noted in the video reviews/how-tos, you\u2019ll need a sort of \u201crig\u201d since it drains via gravity and may be a little too big to remain in one\u2019s bathroom or have a designated space, ya know.<br /><br />As everyone says \u2014 the water input hose does not fit. Go to an Ace Hardware and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s easy enough to adapt but I haven\u2019t done that yet. So far I\u2019ve either poured water in using big Tupperware. My sink is slow and this takes a while. Big downside.<br /><br />The instructions are *just* indecipherable enough to not be useful (features a bad word in there too). I watched a couple videos here and then riffed. I fill the wash tub about 3/4 full and used the 2/5 level of liquid in the detergent measuring cup. Ran a gentle cycle. Water does get grody, it\u2019s great. Drain it out. Then, I refilled the wash bin without detergent for the rinse cycle. Makes sense, right? Drain again and plop half the laundry in the spinner \u2014 DO NOT forget the little plastic thing on top. This thing SPINS. People were saying clothes were like 90% dry and I assumed that was an overestimate but they really do come out incredibly dry for not having a heat source. Air dry that, spin dry the rest, air dry, done. Might have to relocate the unit. Lift with your legs, kids\u2026.not your back.<br /><br />Will update if any more pertinent info comes up.<br /><br />Update!<br />Err on the side of LESS detergent. More detergent will leave your stuff crunchy and weird. A couple of my towels have come out a little misshapen (temporary? Permanent? I don\u2019t know)\u2026.other clothing, perfectly fine. This includes washable shoes like Allbirds, which I wash, rinse, squeeze by hand and leave in the sun to air dry without a spin dry.<br /><br />Honestly, I love this thing.

We pay $1.75/wash and $1.25/dry in the &#34;community&#34; laundry facilities in our complex's basement. What a rip off. One day I was poking around on Amazon and I stumbled upon the wonderful world of PORTABLE WASHERS. WHO KNEW?! It was the answer to my prayers.<br /><br />We put it in the shower/tub area of our apartment. Took basically no time to set up. We hopped over to Ace Hardware and bought a dishwasher hose set (just a long plastic water tube with 2 rubber ends with metal tighteners on the ends) and it fastened nicely to the shower head area and the cheapy water hose they give you. You just have to do a little DYI-ing to get this thing hooked up- but honestly it's so simple and worth EVERY ounce of effort.<br /><br />We never have to use the apartment complex's laundry anymore, and it saves us a LOT of money. Also saves us detergent I am sure as well, since you only need such a small amount.<br /><br />It is a VERY powerful machine (much more than I anticipated) and you can actually fit quite a bit of clothes in it as well. The spin &#34;dryer&#34; is not an actual dryer, it mimmicks the spin cycle on a washing machine. However, it does get your clothes quite dry! (Will still need to hang dry or put in actual dryer). Also I will add it does make doing laundry much more time consuming, since you have to tend to the machine every 6-15 minutes to drain, or switch over, or refill, etc. (which I am not even mad about, because again, saving $$$)<br /><br />Overall, I would say this has been hands-down, the absolute BEST thing I have ever purchased on Amazon, and I have purchased a ton.

The spin tub spins out about 90%+ water so the garments are almost dried but you must split the load as the spin tub is smaller and understandably so for it's purpose. It is very easy to use, quiet and the size/dimension is perfect for my RV shower stall. The only thing that surprised me is how little laundry soap is required to clean. I added more than I should have. The agitator moves so well that you really only need a tablespoon or 2 of laundry soap/detergent.<br />If you are looking for a small unit for your RV, off-grid, small apartment etc, I highly recommend this unit!

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "LIFE CHANGING!", "text": "I have been living in a travel trailer for almost 3 months. On Nov 8th, my beautiful town of Paradise CA, was burned to the ground, in the WORST fire in CA history. 97% of the town was destroyed.  (Camp Fire on Youtube). Tens of thousands of people were displaced,  and sadly 90 people perished.  This was the most horrific thing I have ever been through.  Sorry, for the sad preface to this review, I'm trying to tell you the reason for buying this little washing machine.  As I said, I have been living in a travel trailer since the fire. I have several health issues that limit my mobility, so lugging laundry to a laundromat, was becoming an issue. After reading reviews on many options, I chose this little LIFE SAVER! I know this sounds cheesy, but it has been life changing! It fits perfectly in the shower of my RV. (pix attached) I use the hand held shower to fill it with water! After washing a load, it drains, right down the shower. This machine might be small, but it is MIGHTY! The key is to not to overload it. When properly loaded, the clothes swirl like crazy, and get very clean. After the 15 minute wash cycle, I drain it, refill with cold water, and let it agitate and rinse for 3 to 6 minutes, then drain again. Then I put a couple of items at a time in the spinner, and spin for 5 min. It's incredible how much water comes out of the drain hose spinning just a few items! It's very powerful. The clothes comes out, barely damp. I have a big wooden clothes rack , that I hang them on, and hangers for shirts, to dry. Doing laundry has become so much easier, plus not having to go to a laundromat,  will pay for this awesome little machine in no time!", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FjVuZ1oLL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FjVuZ1oLL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FjVuZ1oLL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AFJGUH75UW2R4L3WRQNJW6XASMGA", "timestamp": 1548894750445, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "AWESOME WASHING MACHINE & SPINNER", "text": "This washer/spinner works great. I use a white plastic pole put together stand. I cut the legs down with a hack saw to measure exactly 12\" high, (or use a power miter saw or whatever) but this stand is a bit unstable, so need to stay with it while washing and spinning; so my suggestion is build a mini pallet, using 2\"x4\" - cut 8\" high - 4 deep on ends, and 4 deep 24\" long for top and bottom, over the end pieces, not inside. Screws from top and sides make this stable. This gives you a 16\" wide solid base to stand washer next to a tub.  (It takes 3-2\"x4\" and wood screws, about $10.) You can get them cut to measure at H D or L so you have the pieces. Use a drill and wood screws to put together. Put whatever you use on a cushioned backed small rug that is turned upside down, so it will scoot when cleaning. I put a colored towel over the rubber backing so it looks nice and on top I folded a heavy towel for the washer to stand on. These accommodations quiet everything down. Noise is not bad but In apartments we need to keep that in mind.

I bought this as a new Mom not wanting to leave my place to go to the washateria with a newborn.<br /><br />This can easily be buyer\u2019s remorse of you don\u2019t have great instructions/tips to follow. Someone posted perfect instructions in the reviews so look out for them. Also know a few things:<br /><br />1) you can sit the dryer in your bathtub<br />2) use a bucket to fill the water in the washer portion. Just make sure it\u2019s not on drain setting while you\u2019re filling or the water will come out lol (I kept making this mistake)<br />3) use a few tablespoons of soap. Literally. (The first time, I used half a cup and tried to rinse my clothes 3 times at 15 minutes each and still the soap was in my clothes, so I had to hand rinse em and that was a nightmare!)<br />4) wring out your clothes after you wash before you put em in the spinner. It will help them dry faster<br />5) this is a spinner not a dryer so depending on how many times you spin, (I recommend 5-7 times, and hang dry afterwards) it won\u2019t be completely dry<br />6) the spinner is half the size of the washer<br />7) you can wash & spin at the same time but it will take some time<br />8) it may help to use an extension cord because the plug is a bit short if you plan to use it in<br />9) you can wash full sized sheets<br />10) don\u2019t put items with zippers and little things that can snag easily in this washer or your clothes may get snagged easily<br />11) don\u2019t forget to empty the lint inside of the washer<br />12) you may need a lint roller after you use the spinner on your clothes<br />13) regular noise level as a traditional washer/dryer if you wash/spin a full load. May be noisy if you don\u2019t have alot of clothes inside the washer or if you forget to use the top inside the spinner on top of the clothes.<br /><br />(THE SPINNER IS NOT A DRYER)<br /><br />Overall, if you don\u2019t wanna do a lot of work, this isn\u2019t the dryer for you because it is a bit of work (filling with water, multiple spins, possibly hang drying, etc.).<br /><br />I\u2019m happy with the purchase and works for me.", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AE6PDA3YW3LC3HRWVBHKAUTVCK2A", "timestamp": 1610003304779, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

I use it for my clothes as well as my husbands and babies. It has washed out all sorts of baby stains. It is a little noisy and has some movement if the spin compartment is slightly overloaded. I probably push this thing to the limit which is why I will sometimes smell something from the motor, but you can surprisingly fit a good amount in this. I like that it is fairly easy to clean so no mold builds up.

(You will be filling bucket after bucket and ends up being a lot of work especially on your back)<br />3) it drains by gravity you will need to find the perfect stools or something to make sure it\u2019s higher to drain. If you do it in the tub the water could burn out the motor.<br />4) if you don\u2019t get a stool or something higher, get a rubber mat for the tub.<br />5) do not put a lot of soap at first will take a long time to rinse<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) it\u2019s quiet enough<br />2) it\u2019s light<br />3) easy to tuck away<br />4) for me personally easier, instead of carrying laundry down 3 flights of stairs to go to a laundry mat, and pay a lot of money.<br />5) it does spin, the water is always colored<br />6) the dryer works more than I even believe.", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AELWJIMXDYEZIXQMTYJSW5CJYD2Q", "timestamp": 1602813040881, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

My bathroom is too small to use this in so I keep it by the kitchen and use a bucket to fill the machine and to put the dirty water in. So it takes some work to use it, but I\u2019m willing to put the work in.<br /><br />The spin cycle is small but it gets things about 90% dry. I even put a down pillow in and it was fine. I can fit a full body towel in there and it\u2019ll be fine.<br /><br />If you\u2019re in college or a small apartment I recommend this highly. But it might be too small for two people or more.

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "HORRIBLE PRODUCT! Save your money.", "text": "I purchased this product in early May. By September, the spin dryer no longer worked. When I used it last, the spinner began to make a very loud mechanical sound and then turned off abruptly. Afterwards, the dial would turn and make a low buzzing noise, but the spinner would not start. The washer works fine, but it is pointless to use without the spinner because it takes so much effort to drain the machine. Even after you completely drain, your clothes are still lying in a significant amount of water. The hose is too small to fit on any faucet. I had to use a bucket to fill the washer manually, which definitely took some time since I had to keep refilling the bucket. To drain, you have to lift the machine into the tub or sink because it will not drain on a flat surface due to how the hose is attached to the machine. The manual is almost impossible to figure out because it was originally written in another language and then reprinted in English using some cheap translation service. You can't make any sense out of the directions or trouble shooting sections.<br /><br />Also, this machine is loud. So if you live in apartment where washers are not allowed, you should reconsider purchasing this product. The spinner makes a lot of noise and it is obvious that a washing machine is in use once you start your cycle. My neighbors a floor above me told me they could definitely hear it when it was in use.<br /><br />I reached out to the sellers twice and they have not responded to any of my requests for a refund.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Perfect for RV use!", "text": "I really love this little washer and spin dryer! It does a great job cleaning and most of the clothes come out about 80% dry. I hang them up and they are dry by morning. The only issue I have is that even when the setting is on normal, some of the water is still draining from the washer while I\u2019m trying to fill it up. I have to keep the hose up and attached to the side so it doesn\u2019t come out. Not a huge deal but it didn\u2019t do that at first so I\u2019m not sure what happened to it. I still love having this in my 5th wheel and it\u2019s saving us so much money instead of going to the laundromat. I originally kept it in the tub and took it out when someone needed to shower but being pregnant that got old fast haha. So I bought a cart from target and keep it on the second shelf (didn\u2019t install top shelf) so it had plenty of height for the hose to drain off into the tub. I also just wheel it over to the shower and use the detachable shower head to fill it instead of messing with the fill inlet. My process for using it to get the best results is: fill washer up to H fill line, add detergent, set timer for 2 minutes to get everything mixed up, add clothes (keep darks and lights separated otherwise you\u2019ll end up with a lot of lint on your dark clothing), run for 15 minutes, drain, fill back up, add 1/4 cup vinegar (helps get all the detergent out and acts as fabric softener, you can\u2019t smell the vinegar when they\u2019re done), swish for 2 minutes, drain, add half clothes to dryer and spin for 3 minutes, then the other half same time.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Perfect for Anyone Currently Handwashing Laundry or Apartment Dwellers", "text": "Life changer for me.  I bought this (from another retailer - wanted to be able to use PayPal 6 months no interest, no payments) because I wanted a lightweight portable washer with a gravity drain.  A pump (to me) was just another thing that could break and would just make the machine heavier.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1). The water intake pipe does not fit any faucet in my home.  I tried to find a turkey baster in 4 different stores in town, no luck.  I just use a funnel and hold it up to my shower head for ~5 mins to fill for large loads.<br /><br />2). The power cord is too short.  I have to use an outdoor extension cord for it to reach an outlet in my bathroom.<br /><br />3).  Lint trap does almost nothing. Even doing towels, it barely catches any hair or lint.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1).  Lightweight - very easy for me to lift in and out of my bathtub<br /><br />2).  Quiet - I live in a 2nd floor apartment.  To keep it quieter and prevent damage to my tub, I bought some no slip drawer liners and dense scrubby sponges from the Dollar Tree to cushion the &#34;feet&#34;.  It also prevents the washer from &#34;walking&#34; when the spinner is unbalanced at first from just being loaded.  TIP:  if you use the water intake to rinse, start rinsing a few seconds BEFORE you turn on the spinner and continue rinsing until the drain water is clear - balances the load much quicker.<br /><br />3).  Cleans very well.  Haven't had an issue with clothes not being thoroughly clean after a 6 minute cycle. Uses much less detergent, bleach, and fabric softener too - about a tablespoon each (little less on softener) for full loads.<br /><br />Overall, no real complaints.  While it is not perfect,  I don't have to spend tons of quarters on laundry anymore.  A few household items or dollar store hacks help where the machine does fall short.  I now can't use the excuses of I don't have laundry money -or- It's too cold/hot/rainy to lug this stuff up to the laundromat.<br /><br />Edited to add:  For anyone with kids - this does fit and properly wash/spin a twin sized comforter.  I wouldn't put the sheets in at the same time because I think it wouldn't clean as well, but they would fit if you truly didn't want/have a second load.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Qr1UvZdwL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Qr1UvZdwL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Qr1UvZdwL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tIlIjtPnL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tIlIjtPnL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tIlIjtPnL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AHWF3DTHQVMJM5EPE5OEBPGE5AHA", "timestamp": 1497220903177, "helpful_vote": 20, "verified_purchase": false}

I had watched a video that a reviewer on here had done and was already familiar with it. Plus, I compared to other options A LOT but finally decided this was the one for me. Anyways, I filled it up (which no, the hose that should attach to the sink does NOT fit to my sink, but it really wasn't that hard to stand there and hold it up to the faucet to let it fill.) about 3/4 of the way. I used the full 15 minutes wash, but it really wasn't necessary. Loaded the clothes. And was amazed! It doesn't make barely any noise. (I was worried about it since I live on the third floor with a couple neighbors) took barely any soap. Once it's done, it'll stop and you have to get the hose ready to switch it to drain on the middle switch, then switch and it came out (washed SO well too, you could see the dirt!!!!!!). You have to wring out the clothes to put them in the spinner but it's not that bad at all. Throw them in the spinner, and boom. Five minutes and they're almost more dry than an electric dryer would get them! I swear. I still hung them up to make sure but they didn't take long to dry after putting a fan on them. And I don't know why some of the other reviews are saying you can't use the washer and spinner at the same time? Because I was able to. Anyways, I don't ever write reviews but this called for it. I did my research, my comparing, my agonizing over it.... It's going to make my life a million times easier. There is a bit of work involved, but hello it's laundry.

As you can see from my second photo I used an old shower head line that I attached to the line that was supplied with this unit, so whenever I have to use it all I have to do is unscrew the new shower head line and screw in this washer line it's so easy. Two very important things to note if you plan on buying this product is first it is NOT an automatic washer so if you're the lazy sort don't bother with this because you do need to fill it up with water and drain it each time you use this which can be a lot of work, and second is do not and I repeat do not overfill this product because you can easily damaged it and it won't clean the clothes that well if you overload it. I would say to be safe don't fill it up past the medium line with clothing I would suggest looking at the video that I posted with this review it shows that your wash should spin just as freely as it does in the video oh, if your clothing gets too bunched up and it barely spins then you have overloaded it.

Super irritating, but I spent enough time trying to diagnose the problem to figure out that if you tilt the machine back the tub will re-engage with the motor and start working again.  So put the clothes in the spinner, turn it on,  and then tilt it back so the front bottom edge is 4 or more inches off the floor while the back legs remain on the ground.  Adjust your tilt until it's spinning freely again.  Not ideal, but I don't care since the alternative is heaps of dripping wet clothes.<br /><br />Overall I am happy with this washer. Really like that you can use it like a hamper and then just run it every couple days and hang the clothes to finish drying. Also like how easy it is to customize the water temperature, which is not possible on commercial washers.  It uses a surprisingly small amount of detergent, yet cleans really well.

I contacted the seller and they assured me that they \u201ctest every one\u201d before it leaves the shop (...ok) and I could return it if it sucked.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Laundry solution", "text": "This is a portable washing machine.  The brand is Costway.  It works by washing clothes in one side and the other side is a spin dryer.  The spin dryer leaves the clothes damp.  They can then be hung on a clothesline or placed on a drying rack.  It does not have a pump so you will need to manually raise the machine higher than the level of the drain to drain the water.  It is heavy when full.  The washing machine was slightly damaged when I received it (cracking around the edge under the lid).  I decided it was not in an area that would affect the functionality of the machine and choose to keep it.  The capacity of the machine is about 3-5 adult size items.  I have also washed twin size sheets, throws, towels and light weight blankets.  In the plus column, This machine does indeed get clothes clean and is much more economical than the laundry mat. In the minus column, the machine isn't built for long term durability.  The hoses which attach to the machine are made of the cheapest possible material and have begun to leak already.  The connector which is provided to attach to the faucet is impractical.  It won't fit anything.  I use a funnel to fill the machine and hold the hose until the machine fills. It takes about 3 minutes.  The spin dryer works inconsistently.  The clothes get out of balance and you have to stop, readjust, try again. All in all,  the concept of the machine works very well.

This is the perfect solution to my public-laundry woes.<br />Pros:<br />-It\u2019s compact and fits into a small space in my small bathroom.<br />-The gravity drainage system means I can place the drain tube in my shower without moving the unit. Because there isna slight lift into the shower, the tube doesn\u2019t empty entirely, but it isn\u2019t enough of an issue to concern me.<br />-This only requires a standard electric outlet to operate. There is no extra wiring or plumbing needed to set it up and operate it.<br />-The wash capacity is pretty impressive for a portable machine. I can fit nearly as much into it as the apartment machine I\u2019ve used for the past<br />6 years. You can add items to the wash cycle after it\u2019s started, so it\u2019s easy to ensure you\u2019re not over-filling.<br />-It gets your laundry incredibly clean. I included a picture of the water draining after a wash cycle so you could see how much dirt it got out. Embarassing but helpful.<br />-The spin cycle gets the items so dry! Seriously,<br />I\u2019m surprised every time.<br />-I can do my laundry without ever leaving my apartment!! This alone makes it worth every penny!<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The water hoses for filling the machine are woefully short, and are equipped to hook up to no faucet I\u2019ve ever seen.  I may one day purchase longer hoses to allow me to fill the wash tub from my bathroom sink, but in the meantime I\u2019ve been using a bucket I fill from the bathtub.<br />-It\u2019s a little labor intensive. Manually fill the wash tub, run a second cycle to rinse, split the wash into two parts to spin, hang everythig to dry. This isn\u2019t the kind of washing machine where you can push a button and let it do its thing. It needs babysat, but for me, the work is worth it for the convenience.<br />-The spin compartment is so much smaller than the wash compartment. I imagine it has to do with  the motor placement, but it\u2019s taken 3 spin cycles sometimes to finish off the load.<br />-It\u2019s a little noisy. I live on the top floor and am always worried about causing too much noise for the downstairs neighbors. I\u2019m going to purchase a mat for this to sit on to absorb the noise, and to keep it from \u201cwalking\u201d across the tile as it agitates and spins.<br /><br />I\u2019ve told so many people about this machine.

The building doesn't have shared machines either so she has to go to the local laundromat to do her laundry and pay money for each load.  Installation took a little while because I had to go to the hardware store to get an adaptor for drainage but other than that, it was pretty simple.  You have to do a few more loads then usual with this because of the small size but the spin cycle does get everything fairly dry and then I just hang dry the rest of the way.  Saves some money every month too since I don't have to go pay for the janky old machines at the laundromat.  It does take a little more work on my part to get the laundry done, but it's worth the savings and not having to go sit and wait for the laundry to get done somewhere else.  Something I've figured out is that you can wash and spin dry at the same time and it will still drain the water out of the spinning side even if it isn't set to drain on the dial.

Draining it is a nightmare. You either need a floor drain or have it up on a stand so the gravity drain can drain down a normal washer drain. It\u2019s a pain to move from room to room. It\u2019s awkward, heavy, and takes up a lot of space in a very small bathroom, if that\u2019s how you intend to use it. It\u2019s nearly impossible to clean under the lids. The plastic drain hose gets horribly gross and is also next to impossible to clean. Inside the spinner is ACTUALLY impossible to clean and it gets gross. It\u2019s made of flimsy plastic and a few motors. The timer/on switch began to die. The washing method it employs does not get your clothes clean, and it also takes FOREVER to do your laundry unless you do it every single day. Don\u2019t even get me started on the inlet hose. It is not a real size of standard plumbing. I spent countless hours at hardware stores and on my floor wanting to rip my hair out over trying to get a hose that would attach to my washer hookups and then into the washer. It was a nightmare. The plastic hose provided is trash and ended up with a leak within months. Please don\u2019t waste your money. Go to a local Habitat for Humanity if you live in the states and pick up a used washer and dryer set. It cost me exactly the same to buy a used set there that has served me so well than it did to buy this chinese garbage. If your problem lies in not having transportation or no hookups, look up the small compact washers sold in Japan. Panasonic makes some amazing ones.

Given, as with most things bought sight unseen, there maybe be compatibility issues with attaching the inlet hose to your particular faucet. This is  easily remedied, no plumber needed. What I did was use the Danco 10086 VersaSpray Handheld Shower to extend and adapter, you can buy it here: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B003OJ3LP0/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1 If you cannot fit the adapter over your faucet, no worries mine didn't either, you can unscrew the handheld shower head and screw that into you shower outlet (it fits all standard aka 1/2&#34;) and cut off the adapter with scissors on the hose I went about an inch under the adapter. Now just slide the cut end into the given water inlet hose in the side with the hard rubber insert and use a small stainless steel hose clamp to secure the seal. I think I used a 16mm one, you can buy them on Amazon in multipaks or just go to Home Depot it's like a buck. I have this in my bathroom standing on Whitmor Commercial-Grade Steel Supreme Wide Stacking Shelf (bc yeah at this price it is a gravity drain, but it works fine just elevate it or if you have a floor drain just stick the hose in it, I don't so I put it on a stand) also can buy here: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007MHD24/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 the wide one (14 x 30 x 15 inches) is the perfect height to set drain hose in tub and the width and depth fits the machine with room to spare. You could also just put this directly into your tub and negate the extra cost of a stand or, as a gentleman here stated, you can lay a plank across the tub and set the washer on top, also cheap alt to buying a stand. All in all I spent about $20 extra to make this product perfect for me, but I could have certainly gotten away with buying only a a 1/2&#34; garden hose adapter and clamp for $2-3 dollars at home depot. Oh, also the electric cord was too short for me as well, I had 6' surge protector so I just used that which is probably a better idea anyway, safer plus I can cut off the electricity to it with the switch.<br /><br />Really though, this guy is great, you should see the filth going down my drain, lol, really works hard, but gentle on clothes, love love love it! It's not very loud at all, mostly humming and some clicks when the washer changes directions, the spinner is louder (not insanely loud or even regular washer loud) but you only use it for &#60;5min so no biggie. Spinner is fantastic, it really does get the vast majority of the water out, I was very surprised, happily surprised. I live in a small loft apt and I am so happy to not have to lug to the laundromat and I can wash my clothes as I need to.

It works well and does get my clothes clean. The washing on low and medium water levels is not a problem and it holds quite a few lighter items. The only cons i have are that 1. it leaks when using high water level,not terribly,but enough that I seldom use it. and 2. the hose is useless for any standard American household faucet. I use mine on my counter and I use the spray attachment on my sink to fill it and empty it into the sink which works well for me but if you don't know how to gerry rig it like other buyers have suggested or can not, I can see this being a problem for you. Over all I am very happy with this purchase and would buy again.<br /><br />Edit 6/8/2020 I should have edited this last year but honestly I was so upset with the seller I didn't even want to mess with it anymore. While it worked well for about a year as far as I can recall,it stopped spin drying suddenly. I tried contacting the seller but never got a reply and numerous searches on YouTube didn't help me figure out the problem. To be fair it did work well and can still be used to wash but my hand strength isn't enough to wring out clothes by hand anymore. My main complaint here is that the seller never bothered to respond to me.  Wasn't asking for a refund as I knew it was too long after the purchase all I wanted was help figuring out the problem.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "I am thrilled with this machine!", "text": "I don't think I've ever written an Amazon review, but after reading (and profiting from) others' reviews of this machine, I wanted to add my tips.<br /><br />I have lived in my apartment for almost a year, and I was having trouble carrying loads of laundry up two flights of stairs and to the laundry mat. I felt it was a significant waste of time and money, too. So I happened to learn that these little compact washers were on Amazon, and I decided to give this machine a try, after reading everyone's comments/reviews.<br /><br />When I received the machine, I was happy to see how small and compact it was. I had measured the shower in my second bathroom and ascertained that it would fit. I also ordered a sturdy dunnage rack, so it could drain properly and an extension cord.<br /><br />I tried installing the hose via the turkey baster method, but found ineffective and not so elegant. I friend of mine (who happens to be a plumber) called while I was installing the turkey baster and he burst out laughing. He said he'd be over in five minutes, and he took me to Home Depot where he found three small connectors (the white thing that fit my shower pipe, a connector, and a metal clamp for good measure). Cost for all three items was around $4. After he helped me install the connectors, it was perfect!<br /><br />Finally, I ordered a few drying racks -- a smaller one for regular laundry and another one for sheets. I have also washed my bathroom mats in this machine with no problem. Seriously, all of these things were a small investment (maybe $300 total), but the time and effort it saves me is worth it! I do one or two loads of laundry a week, dry things on the racks, and voila! No stress, no danger of falling down the stairs with heavy loads of laundry, and no accumulation of laundry over two or three weeks. I love this machine!<br /><br />Here are the other things I ordered on Amazon to make the laundry process effortless:<br /><br />Dunnage Rack<br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00962TWS4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00__o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br /><br />10\u2019 Extension Cord:<br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075BMVZ2M/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01__o00_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br /><br />Stainless Steel Laundry Drying Rack:<br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LWUNVDI/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04__o00_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br /><br />Stainless Steel Laundry Drying Rack:<br />https://www.amazon.com/Cresnel-Stainless-Steel-Clothes-Drying/dp/B00KQU1C60/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&qid=1548524256&sr=8-8&keywords=folding+laundry+drying+rack<br /><br />I hope this helps anyone interested in purchasing this machine.

I figured if this thing worked for 3 months it would effectively have paid for itself.<br /><br />Now I was mad sceptical. Something in my brain said it would be cheap Chinese garbage. Even a visit to Giantex's US website prominently displayed about zero understanding of the English language. Not to say that nothing quality comes from the place, I've just been burned by Chinese products before.<br /><br />Took the risk. After all, most of the reviews are positively glowing. The machine is light enough, but sturdy enough too. We do laundry maybe 2-3 times a week with this machine in our apartments tub.

We've had the machine now for over a month and I expect it to keep going for quite some time.<br /><br />Ultimately we're saving time and money thanks to this machine. The convenience factor of not having to throw everything into a bag and haul it out to the car to bring it to the laundromat is pretty great, too.<br /><br />I only have one minor gripe with the machine. The lint catcher I think sincerely tries to do it's job, it's just not that good. Our shower's drain clogs very easily because of what I imagine it's narrow PVC piping, so after our first go with the machine the drain got clogged with lint. Went out and bought some liquid plumr and a fine mesh shower drain catcher. Now we just make sure the drain catcher is in before draining the machine. Even with the built in lint catcher, the drain catcher gets full of lint every single time. So we have to clean that out between cycles. Minor gripe, only about a 98 cent fix. Not nearly enough for me to dock this product a star.<br /><br />Just wish I got this thing sooner!", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AHRMUX3HDLCWSJ2QOFAXQ2GD32NA", "timestamp": 1572723542687, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

My friend lives in a 3rd world country, and these kinds of machines are very common there; I used hers while visiting there so i was familiar with how to use it before I bought it. This model seemed to be the best deal for the size range. My roommate and I have been using it  for the last 2 months to do all our laundry. We've only been to the laundromat once, to wash our comforters. This machine has been a huge help, especially during the pandemic time. Although laundry takes more effort and time than with a normal machine, I'm quite happy with how this one works. We plan to do laundry on a sunny day so we can line dry the clothes. You do have to do multiple small loads, because it doesn't have a large capacity. It's definitely easier to wash lightweight clothes, like summer things, than washing heavy sweaters and such.  It's been a worthwhile purchase so far.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Bye Bye Laundromat!", "text": "I LOVE this product! It is so much more cost efficient and saves me so much more time than running to the laundromat mat! Also, another added bonus is you get a little bit of a work out when filling up the machine. I transport my water via a bucket so picking it up and pouring it in the machine and repeating the process a few times gets me moving a bit. It could also be viewed as a down side. As previous reviewers have mentioned my hose also does not fit the sink nozzle. Hence, using buckets. I would much rather transport buckets then going to the laundromat so it works great for me. It is a powerful machine. I was worried it wouldnt be strong enough to move clothes around and that I wouldnt be able to wash a lot at once. It can do more than I thought but not as much as what you get in a load as the using a washer and dryer machine from the laundromat. This is a compact machine so I can do two pairs of jeans or two bath towels or three tshirts, ect. I am sure you could put more in because it is powerful but I dont like to since the clothes seem to get more lint on them the more i put in. Make sure you clean that little lent bag out in the washer after every load! The washing machine has two settings normals or a gentle cyle. To be honest I can't tell a difference but there could could be one. This leads me to the noise. Its not a quiet machine. You defidentally know when its running and when it stops from the noise it makes. Its not so loud when you're in another room with the door shut but if you like things quiet this may not be the product for you. Its still a really good product and you can defidentally tell its washing the clothes throughly by the noise. I like the noise since I know when to switch out another load. The dyer also makes noise but its usually the loudest when it starts and not so much towards the end. The dyer wrings out the clothes and depending on the fabric some even feel dry by the time the cyle is done. Most of the time the clothes are damp and need to be hung up to dry over night. The washing cyle is 15 minutes and the dryer is 5. Its up to you if you want to do a longer washing time. I like to do a wash then rinse cyle, so 30 min total and then 5 min in the dryer. Also, I recommend using this product where you don't mind getting the floor wet, say the tub. It drains through the same type of tiny hose as you use to fill the machine. I have been using this machine for half a year and its held up nicely, even the hose are in good condition. Over all im really satisfied with this product! One day I hope to have a home with a washer and dryer machine and retire this machine for traveling say for a camper but for now I am greatful to not have to go to the laundromat!", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AE55D7IYEGHKZMK4GV3CFWITMHIQ", "timestamp": 1604950146401, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

It works 1000x better than coin laundry and it will save you a bundle. You need to keep a few things in mind and I've included my favorite hacks here for super clean clothes:<br /><br />1. If you are looking for a set it and forget it kind of thing don't buy this. It needs babysitting. This machine is somewhere between hand washing and automatic. It does the work, but you have to do some work too.<br /><br />2. Use only a tablespoon or two of soap. I suggest Persil or Tide.<br /><br />3. Load and do not over-stuff. But it will do a lot. I can do a pair of jeans, 2 or 3 t-shirts, some underware and socks all in just one load. Don't overfill the water. Fill about 3/4 of the way up the lint filter inside. I set my wash time for 6 -9 minutes and that's all it really needs.<br /><br />4. Drain and then refill again with cold water and run it for 3 - 4 minutes. Drain.<br /><br />5. Now here is the step that really gets it all clean and all of the soap out of the clothes: Put about half of the load into the spin dryer. I have attached a funnel to the intake right next to the spin dryer and I use a hose from the sink to run water into the spin dryer for about one minute while it spins. This way when the water runs clear out of the hose and into the sink or tub you will know the soap is gone. Turn off the water. Let it finish spin drying completely.<br /><br />Sometimes the machine will require that you hang on or support it while it spins. No big deal. I have mine up on the kitchen counter and just lean against it to keep it from walking.<br /><br />Your clothes can then be line dried or check out the &#34;Manatee&#34; standing dryer here on Amazon for quicker hang drying. Clothes will be soap-free and not stiff if you follow these steps using the water intake for part of the spin dry to completely remove all soap.", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AEBCZ2KNS7DPFEGDZONFPRDXIYXQ", "timestamp": 1516155129517, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Satisfied", "text": "Thanks to corona virus I am scared to go do laundry and decided to order this machine. I\u2019m very happy with this purchase because it gets the job of washing clothes done. Don\u2019t think that this machine is going to have the same result of doing laundry with a regular washer and dryer, you have to accept the machine for what it is. I will be doing a video of my laundry day routine to show exactly how the machine works and with specific details but let me try to sum it up for now. The wash compartment is big enough to hold most of my clothes (I do laundry every week) as long as I don\u2019t wear a bunch of jeans and sweaters. The thicker/heavier the material, the less clothes you should put in. It is important to put only a little bit of soap because if not, you\u2019re gnna have to do a bunch of rinse cycles to get all of the soap out. The little lint catcher that is in the wash compartment does a good job of catching lint but it doesn\u2019t catch all of it. I remove the lint from the catcher after every cycle. I do three wash cycles... detergent cycle, softener cycle, and a rinse cycle and even after the spin cycle there is still lint leftover on my clothes when they dry on the rack so I use a lint roller. Not that big of a deal for me. The spin compartment is extremely small compared to the wash compartment. I have to get my sheets sent out to wash because they don\u2019t fit in the spin cycle. When I wash jeans or really heavy sweats/sweaters I have to spin one at a time. I don\u2019t understand why they made the spin compartment so small because I absolutely love the way it dries my clothes but whatever I accepted it and just take my time. When you initially turn the spin cycle on, it shakes like crazy and so it makes a lot of noise from rocking back and forth but after a few seconds the clothes balance out and it just makes a low noise and then as it\u2019s slowing down to get ready to stop it makes noise again till it stops completely. I usually grab the machine and tilt it against my legs till it balances out because I don\u2019t want it to bang on the floor but because of this, I have to dedicate a day for laundry because I have to be ready to grab the machine after the spin cycle is done before it starts going crazy again. The size of the machine is way smaller than a regular washing machine but still takes up a decent amount of space if you have a tiny apartment like me. I put the machine in my shower and use my shower head to fill it half way Because the tube that comes with the machine is good for nothing. I put the drain tube straight into my shower drain to get all the water out. I spray my machine with cleaner after every wash and rinse with hot water then leave the compartment doors open to allow the inside to dry to avoid mold. I also take out the lint catcher and allow it to dry to avoid it from smelling bad (it\u2019s wet cloth). It might seem like a lot but so far I\u2019m not complaining because it\u2019s saving me money and I don\u2019t have to go out and risk exposing myself to others. As long as I dedicate a day out of the week to properly wash and hang my clothes, it\u2019s very convenient to have. I consider it more of a laundry assistant than a washing machine.", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AFGWNMO6ZDNY4BH2G4ZDTRQDX2MA", "timestamp": 1591954632740, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Works great and is durable", "text": "According to the top of the screen, I bought this in October 2016.  I still have it, use it and have had zero problems.  It may be the best investment I've made.  No trudging up and down the stairs.  No paying $3.50/load in the building machines.  And this holds about as much per load.<br /><br />I found a tub height table that it fits on perfectly.  I used to fill it with a bucket, but then got smart and bought a shower head with the handheld option that has a setting to stop the flow, so I don't get water anywhere.  I just but the shower head in the washer and let it fill up.  (I recommend getting one those cheap flower shaped lint catchers to back up the built-in one.  Especially if you have pets.)  After the first wash, I drop the hose into the tub and let it drain.  Then refill for a rinse.  Pro Tip:  Be sure to move the dial back to wash before filling.<br /><br />Next, move the laundry to the spinner.  It will only take half of what the washer holds, so you'll be spinning 2 or 3 times depending on what your washing.  The spinner runs for 5 minutes, but I tend to let it go about 2 minutes and my laundry is pretty much dry.  I'll use the full 5 if I'm washing something that holds a lot of water, like jeans...or if I've gotten distracted.  I set up foldable tv tray to hold the wet clothes, so I can spin the second load while I hang the first.  If I feel that the rinse may not have gotten all of the soap out, I'll pour water into the spin cycle through it's water inlet.  One of those really cheap small collapsible funnels fit it perfect so you can easily put the water in.<br /><br />After I'm all done for the day, I lift one side of the washer to get any remaining water out.  Open up both tops and let it air dry.  And that's it.<br /><br />It's a little bit more work than a typical washer/dryer.  But it has already paid for itself a few times over.  When it's time for a new one, I'm considering the all in one type - that's 3 times the price, but even more convenient.  My only advice is to consider the set up for your home.  If you can't figure out a way to gravity drain it - then you may do better paying more and getting one with a pump. If I have any regrets - it's that I didn't get the pump.  But I got this on sale for around $100 and that fit my budget at the time.<br /><br />Seriously - stop pondering and just buy it.  You can thank me later.  :)", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AE43KAB3SY26LEYQ2I35KD5BSJOQ", "timestamp": 1597020045417, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}
{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Overall, pretty happy with the machine. Easy to use if you know what you're doing.", "text": "Update: I have had this for a couple weeks now and figured out some &#34;hacks&#34; and tips.<br /><br />I place this in my tub and found no issue with that. I use our bathroom sponge to balance the machine and ease vibrations. I also went to my hardware store and bought a showerhead diverter, a 30-in 1/2&#34; faucet supply hose, and a brass &#34;barbed&#34; adaptor. *Ensure these all connect in the store before purchase!* Sadly, 8 forgot the hose that came with the package, but I zip-tied it a couple times to get a decent seal. I always leave a little slack so any stray leaks don't get on the machine. Makes life easier just turning on the shower and filling/rinsing the machine this way. Cost of this was $30 but worth it! I am a 6'5&#34; guy and I threw my back out filling the machine over and over. Plus, you can do a rinse and spin to get the suds out.<br /><br />With this machine, you must always think &#34;less is more&#34; and if it looks like enough, it's already too much. A decent load, to measure, is whatever can fit in the spin basket plus a one extra, light thing. When the wash cycle is going, you want to see a vortex... a whirlpool effect. If your clothes are floating and spinning at the top struggling to be washed, you've overloaded. Pull out items one by one until you get that whirlpool.<br /><br />You can spin and wash at the same time. The spinner drains regardless of the middle knob is set to drain, and if you overfill the wash tub it will drain whatever overflows. Plan this accordingly.<br /><br />Noise is compareble to an AC unit, and there are vibrations depending on where you place it and how level it is. I use a sponge balance and absorb some vibrations. Not fancy, but works.<br /><br />I reuse my hot water, topping off the wash tub each time. The water may look gross but it's fine as there's soap already in it. Dry cleaners reuse their chemical wash hundreds of times over and your clothes come out fine, plus you'll rinse it all. My whites come out whiter than the commercial washers too, so you're saving money and resources.<br /><br />I'm still very happy!<br /><br />***<br /><br />Where do I start? Well, I have spent a good portion of the few weeks looking at portable washing solutions as my apartment does not have a washer set-up, and I got tired of using the public washers in my apartment community. All the coins needed, going back and forth, waiting for machines to open, ensuring I had enough quarters at the time, and the entire day had to be devoted to laundry more often than not.<br /><br />So, I shopped around, reading reviews and watching videos of different machines. This one stuck out as it's reasonably affordable and does a great job, according to reviews. I live in the Bay Area and this ships for Los Angeles, so I got it within a couple days (excluding a holiday and weekend). The box was in good shape and unclipped the ties. A whiff of &#34;new plastic&#34; and staring in awe, there it was, just as in the pictures. Unboxing was easy, unclip the ties and lift the top part off. A brand-new washer!<br /><br />I grabbed the instruction manual and flipped through it. As other have joked on here, it's in Engrish with such gems as &#34;choke the dial&#34; and &#34;put staff not under.&#34; I tossed it aside because it's useless, most reviews give you the rundown. Here's mine, if you need it:<br /><br />Step 1: Place a splash of soap, no more than a heaping tablespoon's worth or the soap will take forever to rinse out. You don't need to measure, but just guess and be cautious.<br />Step 2: Place clothing in machine, one item at a time. Sort your items keeping towels in one load, basics in another, denim in another, and so on. Fill the machine just over half full with basics. Towels and denim should be washed in smaller loads as they're heavier fabrics.<br />Step 3: Ensure middle dial is set to &#34;Normal&#34; or &#34;Soft&#34; and fill with water. The &#34;inlet hose&#34; is useless out of the box as you need an adaptor that the manufacturer assumed you had. One end has a rubber gasket and the other end does not. The gasket end is the part that would go to an adaptor, the gasket-less end goes to the machine. Why? Because if you hook the gasket to the machine, it's harder than heck to get it off without nearly destroying the hose. During the inaugural load, I did not have an adaptor, so I filled the wash basin with a bucket. Fill just slightly over half-full, any more will splash out during the agitation cycle.<br />Step 4: Check to see of the machine is plugged in. I forgot to do this and sat there confused. Turn the &#34;Wash&#34; dial to 15 minutes and the machine will hum to life. Let the machine do its thing and come back when it is done. It doesn't make any alarm when it's done, just so you know.<br />Step 5: You may come back to, what I would describe as a burning smell. I was alarmed at first but nothing was wrong, it's &#34;new motor smell.&#34; Turn the middle dial to drain and the water will come pouring out of the drain hose. There is no pump, so try to have the machine elevated or set in your bathtub.<br />Step 6: Open the spinner basin and place a few items in, ensuring that it evenly loaded (about half of the wash load). Place the plastic insert in the bin on top of the laundry, close the lids. Is the middle dial still set to drain? Good. Leave it. Turn the &#34;Spin&#34; dial to 5. If you have the &#34;inlet hose&#34; hooked to an adaptor, this is where you can do a spin and rinse. If not, you can spin the suds out and wash again in clean water real fast, then repeat the spin. The machine will vibrate during the spin, and if it vibrates to a point where you think it is too much, stop the spin cycle and rearrange your items. Everything comes out damp, not wet. Like others have said: &#34;About 90% dry.&#34;<br /><br />When putting away the machine, tilt it slightly toward the direction of the drainage hose to get the rest of the water out. I set the machine aside with the lids open as to prevent a musty smell in the future. I will say this: Don't overwhelm the machine. Do a couple washes and allow the machine to cool and rest for a couple hours, say, while your laundry is drying on a rack. If you overexert the machine, it will break. EEK! It's more for daily loads (every day or every other day) than for a single day of wash (&#34;laundry day&#34;).<br /><br />It's a great compact machine that gets your laundry as clean as most large washing machines. It takes a bit more effort on your part to tend to each load, but it's easier than running up and down flights of stairs, digging in the sofa for coins, and fighting over the next machine. I plan on finding a cart to place this on so I can store it easier, and find an adaptor that will fit the inlet hose.<br /><br />I will update this as time goes on. It's a really simple machine, gets the clothes clean, and I am saving some money from the get go compared to the few bucks it takes each wash in the laundromat.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/615gqNi914L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/615gqNi914L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/615gqNi914L.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61EtrQuQJtL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61EtrQuQJtL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61EtrQuQJtL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AF7PVTKXZD5GV367AN6VCG7W4DPA", "timestamp": 1479184122000, "helpful_vote": 2264, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Neat little washer", "text": "After a few months of researching this and other portable/automatic machines, and being fed up with going to the laundromat, I broke down and bought this.  I am fully aware this machine will require a bit more \"work\" as opposed to an automatic, but I'm ok with that.  I don't have much laundry anyway, but I plan on just doing more frequent smaller loads throughout the week, and still have to go to laundromat for comforters, but that'll only be every other week.  I figured I could suck up losing 100. on this vs. 300. on an automatic portable one if this ended up being a dud.  I do have regular laundry hook ups, but my old style washer broke down, and I'm trying to baby my septic system.  I have my eye on a full size HE washer in the next few months, and a plumber to re-route my washer grey line.<br /><br />I've used this a few times now, and initially I was disappointed at how small the washer tub seemed, the videos made it appear larger.  I thought they sent wrong one, but nope, it was right.  Just to give an idea, the tub part to wash is about 19 inches deep-from my elbow to middle finger tip.  And, there's no high water mark that I can see, I just go by the lint filter, and fill to about the middle of that; which is about 5-6 inches from the top.  I think if you go much higher than that, it'll start splashing out of the lid.<br /><br />First, I want to note, as others say just a bit of laundry detergent is needed.  When filled up, this is about 10 gallons of water.  I cringed at some of the videos where all you saw were suds.  That doesn't equate to cleaner clothes.  It can actually attract dirt and grease if not rinsed out good, and make the clothes stiff.  I just did two loads of sheets.  First was twin fitted, flat, 3 standard pillow cases.  I realized after I should've used a bit more water.  The sheets kind of bunched at the top rather than doing the whirlpool thing.  Washed for 15 mins, then drained the water, refilled the tub part and added fabric softener.  Did about 6 min rinse in the tub part and drained.  Moved the 3 pillow cases to spin for about 3 mins.  I noticed the polyester materials spun out almost dry, and the cotton one was fairly dry.  So, next round I decreased to 2 mins and they came out the same.<br /><br />Next load was queen fitted, flat, and 2 standard pillow cases.  They fit and washed fine, just made sure water level was high enough.  Some may say ewww, but I reused some of the rinse water from previous load to wash this load.  My clothes aren't soiled badly, and the water was clear.  I used a 5 gallon bucket.  I have a small cheap walmart end table that's just higher than the bucket, sit it next to my bath tub, and use my shower head to fill it.  I also picked up a 10 foot outdoor extension cord at walmart.  It's a light duty I believe, rated for 13 amps.  I think the back of the washer says it uses just over 13 amps(?).  I've checked the cord plug, it's not running hot/warm, have had no issues.  I drape it over the shower pole and up the top of the bathroom door.<br /><br />Washer is easy to use.  Oh, the directions....Even with my reading glasses, I can't read them.  Print is itty, bitty, tiny, small.  And was written by someone with English not as their first language, but what you can read of it was kind of amusing.  Fortunately I'd done enough research and a bit of common sense, I had a very good idea of what to do/not do.<br /><br />-Most important, research this washer.  It's not an automatic or a typical washer.  Lots of videos here and on youtube.  They'll show you exactly what's needed to be done to use this.  Some people can't or don't want to do the extra work.  Some of us don't mind it.<br />-Yes, you can use the wash/spin at the same time.  Make sure drain is closed/set to normal.  There will be some water come out from the drain hose from the spin though.<br />-Use soap sparingly.  Lots of suds is not a good thing, it does not equate to clean.<br />-Do not overload washer or spin part.<br />-Overall it's quiet, but depending on the load, and what it's sitting on, there may be some vibrational noises-just an FYI for those in upstairs apartments.  Saw someone mention using a rubber mat to help absorb the vibration/sound.<br />-Be mindful, especially those with RV's or septic systems, each wash fill up that's full will be using about 10 gallons of water, and depending how you rinse(in the washer part or the spin part-another 10 gallons in the washer part.  I'm still trying to figure out the best way to reduce the amount of water being used.  Need to figure out how to rig something up to use the spin part for rinsing since hose won't fit from my shower to the intake part.  For now, I'll just reuse the rinse water where I can, maybe even use some for mop water.<br />-It weighs about 25-30 lbs.  I don't find it heavy, but I'm used to lifting heavier items.  It does scoot easily on floors too.  Look into a furniture dolly, about 13. at Home Depot if you have trouble lifting/moving.", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AEQ6LTTJVMIS57E6GNMAAIEKA6XA", "timestamp": 1574891893076, "helpful_vote": 15, "verified_purchase": true}

I figured if I was doing a normal load they would all wash in the same water anyway. We do the rinse the same. And no problems. This will save you guys  a lot of water.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "4 out of 5 mostly because the hose for filling is useless", "text": "I love this mighty little washer!! I wash several loads in 1 day at my own pace while I'm home doing other things around the house. Great for emergency washes like if your child gets suddenly sick and throws up on everything..  I've had this machine for almost a year!! I love it so much I am buying another washer and giving my sister my old one to use for the new baby so she doesn't have to bring the baby clothes to a laundromat. It took about a month to figure out the best way to wash our clothes but I use this for 3 people, 2 adults and 1 child. I wash a week's worth of clothes in 1 day, I hang the clothes around my apartment on hangers, I have an over the door clothes hanging system a canopy bed that I hang the clothes around the frame and if I run out of room I just use the shower curtain rod. You can soak the clothes if they are extra dirty, sometimes my husband gets his clothes extremely dirty from work, so I soak them in moderately hot water for 25 minutes with a tablespoon or laundry soap (I don't actually measure just kind of eyeball  it) wash the full 15 minutes, drain the water, rinse for a minute with fresh water, then refill tub with fresh water and maybe some fabric softener, wash for another 15 minutes then spin dry with water for 1 minute then respin for the full 5 minutes. The clothes come out just barely damp, way dryer than the laundromat! I also use Downy wrinkle releaser spray for when they are drying to keep the clothes softer. I only use a small amount of laundry soap maybe like a tablespoon, it does go a long way! I have it stored in my bathroom and the set up is super easy I use 2 upside down milk crates in the tub with a piece of plywood to cover the top of the crates, I put the washing machine on top of that so the hose can gravity drain right down the tub drain. Also my husband and I went to home Depot and got a few hardware pieces to make the filling much easier, I used some tips from a previous reviewer, we got a split for the shower head and an adapter that we attached a hose to. Also the split for the shower head I just pull up on the nob to switch over to the hose, the push it down to switch back to the shower head. I really recommend this amazing machine totally worth the price and I'd say get the warranty just in case totally totally worth every penny!! Also since I've had this machine I've still gone to the laundromat a hand full of times and have regretted it everytime!! Mostly because of lost socks and how extremely and grossly soaked our jeans come out!! I also refuse to dry jeans at the laundromat I always  bring them home and hang them to dry. Also another til my husband is 6 ft tall and wears a size 40 in jeans/pants/shorts so I am able to fit 1 pair of his big work jeans and 2- 3 of his tshirts in 1 load and they wash beautifully. You really want to make sure that you clothes can spin freely to wash well so don't overstuff!

That's the kind in your bathroom with the push button in the middle.  Cuts the current if a short is detected. Lotta water, lotta current, lots of potential shorts, Chinese make, so a bit dubious on the safety end. You could die. Probably not, but you COULD die.<br /><br />2. Drop it in the tub, no need for a table.  It's light.  A normal woman can lift it empty no problem.  Do your thing, put it in the closet etc..<br /><br />3. Wear rubber soled shoes (flip flops, trainers, etc) while you're using this. Water gets on the floor, dry it up. & if you don't have GFI's & you're renting, take pictures.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Adorable small washer", "text": "Don't expect to fill it to the brim with cloths and water and walk away to read a book.  This is a great little machine that does an awesome job for small loads (think 1 complete outfit).  Washing load is 10 pounds of cloths and spinning is about half that.  The drain is gravity fed so you need to place it INSIDE a tub or shower when operating!<br />I fill up the washer, load a few things, add 1 squirt of detergent, set for 5 minutes, and let it wash.  I do have to open the door with caution to untangle the cloths.  Once wash ended, flip the switch to drain, once all drained, flip the switch back to wash, fill the bin with water to rinse.  Set timer for 3 to 5 minutes.  Once it 'rinses' the cloths, I transfer half the load to the spinner and set for 3 min to spin.<br />We use this is our 27' camper trailer.  It weighs 37 lbs and we place it in the shower to use.  During a three week trip we used it many times to wash our cloths, after the spin cycle, the cloths hang over night are are completely dry in a few hours.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "As incredible as everyone says", "text": "Third update:<br />I have been using this washer for three years and I am still happy with its performance. Sometimes it leaks a little bit out of the foot in the back on the washer side, but I put some plastic underneath it and it\u2019s good as new. My partner just moved in with me and I am showing them how to use this janky, majestic machine. It\u2019s a family heirloom. Best $100 I ever spent.<br /><br />Second update:<br />I have had this washer for over a year and continue to launder all my clothes, towels, and some queen-sized bedding (sheets and duvet cover) in this glorious machine. When I overspend on Amazon purchases, I think fondly of all the money this washer has saved me and I don't feel as guilty. I love this washer and will immediately purchase another one if it someday kicks the can.<br /><br />Updated review:<br />I have had this washer for six months. I am a single person with a roommate. I have washed all my clothes and bedding with this washer for the past six months, and my roommate uses it weekly for sweaters and underwear. I remain impressed with this product. It truly changed my life and saved me from the coin operated laundromat. I have also saved a ton of money since my landlord pays for water.<br /><br />My roommate used some tubing from an old aquarium to fill the washer directly from the utility sink nearby. While the bucket method worked perfectly well, this is better for my back. I am also able to use the spin cycle with clean water flowing through it. I will do this with smaller amounts of clothes, but for bulkier items I still use the method below, where I do a second wash in clean water to rinse them better.<br /><br />Get this washer! I wish I had found it sooner.<br /><br />Original review:<br />I have had this washer for a month and it is incredible for the price. The spin cycle rings so much water out of my clothes that they line dry faster than when I line dry clothes washed in a regular washer. I have elevated my washer using a cheap IKEA coffee table, and I use a bucket to fill and drain the water.<br /><br />I read and watched several reviews here on Amazon to learn about how different people made this less-expensive washer work for them. Here's the formula I've been using successfully: I wash the clothes with soap for nine minutes, drain, spin dry for about one minute (usually needing to divide the load into two), then I wash the clothes again for nine without soap and spin dry for three minutes.<br /><br />If you have the space for this washer, you should definitely buy it.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great value for the price - washer works wonderfully, dryer is OK", "text": "[[VIDEOID:17208bca5f1737fa52db9c606755afe4]] Like most people here, I bought this washer/spin dryer combo because I was sick of lugging my laundry to a community laundry center and shelling out $$ every week to clean my clothes.<br /><br />I love this washing machine! It gets my clothes clean quickly and fairly easily. It definitely takes more work than a traditional washer/dryer, but a lot less work than lugging your clothes somewhere outside of your home.<br /><br />The instructions are fairly useless, so I watched all of the review videos here, which were fairly helpful. There were some questions I couldn't answer easily, like if you run water while the dryer is spinning or before hand, and I have created my own review video that I hope will address any questions not answered in videos by other reviewers.<br /><br />To make the water tube work, you will likely need to adapt it as I and others have. I was able to get it to work with my shower head thanks to the recommendations of Vijay Bhatia (another reviewer.) I personally had difficulty finding the parts as he named them, so here is a written list:<br /><br />- 1/2 inch coupling<br />- hose clamp big enough to slide over the coupling<br />-  1/2 inch nose adaptor (may also be referred to as nipple)<br /><br />Small correction to my video: the nose part of the adaptor goes into the tube, not the coupling. The other half of the adaptor should screw into the coupling, then the other half of the coupling should screw into where the showerhead was.<br /><br />As mentioned in my video, I was not fully satisfied with the dryer on this machine. It does a great job of spinning out excess water, but your clothes will still be damp and you will need to hang dry them. I tried hang drying and my clothes ended up being very starchy and uncomfortable, so I eventually splurged for a heated dryer - a Panda Portable Compact Clothes Dryer (PAN60SF) w/ 13 lb capacity.<br /><br />Why the five stars, then? For the price, the machine is a top performer. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a washer but doesn't have a hookup for a regular one. Just make sure you watch the review videos so you know what you're getting into. Combined with the heated dryer I bought, this machine satisfies my laundry appliance needs.<br /><br />I was NOT compensated for this review and I paid full price ($105.99 at the time) for the product.", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AH4DKL4JZUYXDZEZV5TBUHXRKNDQ", "timestamp": 1476834578000, "helpful_vote": 343, "verified_purchase": true}

It is well-designed for forcing water through your clothes without the harshness of an agitator in a large machine. It's gentle on your fabrics.<br />My dirty laundry no longer piles up until I'm \"in the mood\" to do laundry. I use it as a hamper and when it gets 2/3 full, I run a load. This could be a pro or a con, but running small loads more often means dirty clothes don't sit around. I need to wear a company shirt at work, and I only have three of them, so this washer comes in very handy.... No more hand-washing something I need tomorrow.<br />Cons:<br />The hose it comes with is cheap and useless. I fill the machine with my shower sprayer and run the machine in the bathtub.<br />Because of the incline in bathtubs, it woudn't work because the surface is not level. I used a sturdy plastic chip-and-dip platter underneath the right side of the machine to make it level.. Weird solution, but it works. I'm plumbing-challenged and didn't  want to bother with complicated hook-ups for filling and draining. It's easy to lift in and out of the bathtub.<br />This unit will not handle large, heavy items like comforters, throw rugs or a load of towels.<br />It is not an automatic washer. You have to wash with soap, spin, wash with no soap and spin again. It is not a dryer, but your clothes come out only slightly damp. Hang them to dry and they come out smelling good.<br />This is not a family-size machine. If you have four kids, you'll never keep up with the laundry.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Giantex Costway Portable Washer Working Out for Me", "text": "Writing this review for others thinking of purchasing this  portable twin tub washer.  Reporting about my happy purchase now six months in.  I was washing a lot of lighter weight  or delicate  hand-washables.  That meant  I used to wring my hand-washed clothes by hand and it started to hurt my  hands  and my wrists doing so much wringing out of  hand washables... that's a way to get carpal tunnel.<br /><br />Machine was delivered early Jan. 2021.  I placed the machine in my large shower stall because I happen to have one of those shower benches in there.  I usually lift it and place it  on the shower floor to use, and put the extended drain hose down the shower drain.  I measured and  bought an extension cord that was right for my needs.  I did purchase an additional 3 ft.  drain hose as I didn't want a super long one.  I was able to cut the add on hose end off to feed it into the existing drain hose.<br /><br />So, I'm happy to report  my Giantex Costway washer is working out for me.  I am careful to not  overload it and so far it's worked fine.  The cycles I run are usually under five minutes, as it's a very efficient machine.  I used it today----  I did 3 tee shirts, 1 thermal long sleeved larger tee shirt,  and two long  nightgowns, so 6 items I don't have to lug to the laundromat.  It gives an efficient wash.  I noticed it agitates in one direction,  pauses,  then agitates in the opposite direction.  Neat!  I  can do a normal or soft wash  cycle.  Then, drain, refill with rinse water, agitate, then  once rinse water is drained  with water going right down my shower drain,  I  move the clothes  to  the spin side.  I hang the clothes, but this little machine spins the clothes almost dry.  I looked into the mfg. co. , got the extended service,  and did a lot of research before I purchased it.

A couple times i have forgotten this and the soapy water comes right out lol. I usually add the detergent in the bucket and water it down. You do not need the whole cup of detergent, if you do add it however you would need to rinse at least twice. The washing force is great, the less clothes the better. The dryer leaves the door damp, as it is not a complete dryer. It just takes out most of the water to almost dry. I have had it for about a month and completely love it.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Apartment dwellers read my review to avoid trial and error.", "text": "I have wanted one ever since I got my first apartment without a washing machine, now my life is complete and I no longer have to hang with the weirdos at the laundry mat while handling my undies in public.  It's perfect!<br /><br />It took some maneuvering to find the easiest way to make it work in the apartment but I eventually found some things that I think the average user living in an apartment would find helpful.<br /><br />1 - In an apartment; set it up right next to the bathtub.  Hauling water is no fun.  At first I thought a 5 gallon bucket would be sufficient but as a 5'1\" 100lb girl, it was not.  To do this you are going to need to find something to set it on that makes it higher than the bathtub to allow the gravity drain to work properly.  I got lucky and found one next to my dumpster (seems like every time I pray to the dumpster god he provides) but my original plan was to go to the Habitat for Humanity Restore (if you have one in your area) or look on Craigslist, you can get an old kitchen wall cabinet that's almost the same height as the bathtub.  The cabinet adds more useable space under the machine for storing items like the detergent and toilet paper. PRO TIP: save the foam from the packaging to place under the washer to keep it from bouncing around. Don\u2019t forget the drain hose can be moved from one side to the other as well, just look on the back of the machine you\u2019ll see.<br /><br />2 \u2013 If you are following my advice, you have it right next to the bathtub so don't bother with the plumbing. Like everyone here says, the included hose is short and it won\u2019t fit anything American and chances are whatever water source you hook it up to, you will also need it for something else. If you plan on still being able to wash your hands or take showers and you have a washing machine hose in the way you will constantly have to hook up and unhook it. It\u2019s a pain and there is a much easier way to do it.  If you have an extendable shower head, use that instead.  If not, it's an easy upgrade and you can get one for less than 10 bucks.  But why not go ahead and spoil yourself and get one with multiple settings for your personal showers.  Kill two birds with one stone and get a massage in the process!  You need a hose that will reach it, so 5' minimum if yours is set on the opposite side of the tub from the showerhead. (Mine was) This is probable because the plumbing is usually all in the same wall so therefore your toilet will also be on the same wall.  5\u2019 is standard for most shower heads, but be weary, I came across a few online that were shorter (non-American) so pay attention when you are shopping.  I got mine for $19.99 with 5 settings.  It was as easy as unscrewing the old one, adding some plumbers tape and screwing the new one in.  My roommate thought I was a home construction wizard\u2026 ;)<br /><br />3 - ONLY FILL 3/4 FULL WITH CLOTHING!  The washer works great if you don't overload it.  The ratio should be about 3/4  clothes - 1 water.  If you have something heavier like jeans in there keep an eye on it and make sure it\u2019s able to spin.  I have had to pull heavier items out a few times, or go in and separate things that have knotted together and become too heavy. Examp: my bra can get tied to a sweater and it becomes a ball of sopping wet heavy clothing that\u2019s hard to separate.  After a while you\u2019ll get a feel for what not to mix and how heavy is too heavy to spin.<br /><br />4 - USE LESS DETERGENT!  In a regular washer you wouldn't see the amount of soap that gets left in your clothing but now you will.  1.  The washer is smaller so you need less, 2. You probably already needed less than you were using.  I barely add any now.  If you have soap residue left in your clothing your clothes will be stiff because you\u2019re not going to tumble dry these in a dryer to soften them up.  See number 7.<br /><br />5 - USE VINEGAR.  I know it seems like it would be smelly, but it\u2019s not it washes right out if you don\u2019t use too much.  If you don't have a dryer, lint is harder to get out of clothing.  Vinegar separates the lint, hair, etc. from the clothing.  You'll notice more lint in the trap after using vinegar in your load.  And don't forget to keep that trap clean!<br /><br />6 - Winter use drying - It would be lovely to be able to place this outside to dry, but either you don't have an outside or the weather prevents it.  So set up a space with full circulation to get the fastest dry.  Hang pants from the bottom (see pic).  It dry\u2019s much faster, also spin that extra minute. I\u2019ve noticed if I spin about a minute more than what\u2019s necessary to get most of the water out dry time is decreased by about a full day. Usually you can remove some of the lighter items from your dry rack in about 6 hours to give the heavier items more air space.  With this method I am able to get clothes fully dry within 24 hours.<br /><br />7 - This one is counterintuitive because I\u2019m going to tell you the opposite of what everyone else is going to tell you.  Wash cold/rinse hot or warm.  I usually do it like this: 1st wash cold with detergent, 2nd wash is a rinse with vinegar to remove cat hair and lint and break down the rest of the detergent, 3rd wash hot with a small amount of fabric softener and some essential oils for the smell good just washed feeling.  Here is why.  The last wash leaves the clothes warm/hot and they dry faster and warm water softens the material and it doesn't leave them stiff. You can do all hot washes but your electric bill will go up. This took some trial and error and my clothes were very stiff the first month of using this.  Finishing it in hot water and using vinegar made all the difference! After the clothes are dry just whip them out to get the last of the stiffness out, like snapping a towel at a bare butt, you know what I mean... It\u2019s how I compensate for not having a dryer to tumble them in.  I thought I was going to have to live without fluffy towels from here on out but using this method got my towels fluffy again!<br /><br />I\u2019ve included a pic of how much dirty water is coming out of clothes to prove how clean my laundry is getting.<br />Hope this helps!", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51o-YWCiN7L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51o-YWCiN7L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51o-YWCiN7L.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61HzQBqmUcL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61HzQBqmUcL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61HzQBqmUcL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61UqVg9+VDL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61UqVg9+VDL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61UqVg9+VDL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61cTJUjmqeL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61cTJUjmqeL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61cTJUjmqeL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71erUip2RoL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71erUip2RoL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71erUip2RoL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AEHBF5LSH5XPTHXCWJ7YCYLJYFEQ", "timestamp": 1578961853226, "helpful_vote": 130, "verified_purchase": true}

Air drying the clothes gives longitivity to your clothes than gas dryers. You just need to do your laundry for 30 minutes everyday and you are done!! Get a clothes drying rack and hang your clothes on it. It takes just 5 minutes of your time after washing and drying for 25 minutes. It takes an hour to dry and jeans take 2 hours to dry. Well, you can also see how dirty your laundry is while the clothes are in the washer. Based on that you can drain and add water again to get rid of the dirt. I wish I purchased this sooner but then better late than never ;)<br />Things to know:<br />Drain hose needs to be FLAT to get rid of the excess water. If you are using the drain hose like a roller coaster, then some of the water will be left behind.<br />Buy a wheel stand if you are going to move the machine from one place to another.<br />If you hang the clothes with clothes hanger on the drying rack, your clothes almost don't require Ironing;)", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AEVUMTB3WZBV5WJ3GRC3LJ4K57IA", "timestamp": 1657808278862, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great Solution for Apartments!", "text": "I am writing this as someone who finds themselves in a place for the first time without a washer and dryer, someone who is short and doesn't have a lot of strength, and...as someone who was very nervous to make this purchase, but glad she did!<br /><br />I've had this for about 2 weeks now. I was very worried to purchase this, because I thought it wouldn't work. After reading reviews on here and watching a ton of youtube videos (while at the laundromat!), I decided to buy it and I was NOT disappointed! I have ran this maybe about 8 times already.<br /><br />I have a few comments that were not covered in review videos:<br /><br />-If you are a single person, such as myself, do your laundry once a week. Do NOT let your laundry pile up, or you could very well be doing laundry for HOURS.<br /><br />-The above may seem like a no-brainer, but what they don't tell you is that because the wash time and spin time are so short, be prepared to basically babysit this thing. 15 minutes can go by very quickly, then you're off to start loading the spin cycle..<br /><br />-Which brings me to my next comment, and why this did not get a full 5 stars from me - the spin cycle capacity drum is very tiny! Why they didn't make it the same size is beyond me! This has been the most annoying/frustrating part, and why I say you have to babysit your machine.<br />Normally 1 washing load takes me 3 loads to put in the spin cycle, and the spin cycle only lasts 5 minutes. And maybe 5 minutes isn't enough sometimes (although that 5 minutes is as powerful as most people say, and I'm amazed every time how mostly dry they are). It is NOT that I am overloading - but for example, you're not going to want to put a towel and 2 pairs of pants in the spin cycle - the towel will probably be enough to go in on its own.<br /><br />-Prepared to get wet.<br />As you see, most people fill it up first before putting clothes in, which means you have to plunge your laundry down. Before they go into the spin cycle, obviously they are sopping wet, which you're not used to with a normal washer.<br /><br />Tips<br />-If you are not going to put this in your bathtub or shower, make sure it is elevated for draining. I've seen people use a small table or crates. Unless you are using this outside, you cannot just have it flat on the floor and try to drain it in a bucket without it being elevated - it will not drain, it uses gravity.<br /><br />-I found a brilliant hack for using the water tube from a video on youtube - get a rubber glove, snip off the tip of a finger, and put the hose through it. Secure with rubber band. Put glove over the shower head and secure with another rubber band. Easy peasy!<br /><br />-I have not done this yet, but it was suggested to get a lint catcher ball, and I've seen people use those spiky dryer balls in there for more agitation.<br /><br />-If your clothes are very soiled, it's best to pre-wash them by hand to work on any stains.<br /><br />-Detergent pods DO work and disintegrate in this!<br /><br />-Even if you normally don't, use fabric softener. It helps.<br /><br />Final thoughts:<br />This washer has already paid for itself for the hassle it saves me from loading up my laundry and going to the laundromat (which is worse when you have stairs!) I wouldn't say it saves me time, but it gives me the freedom of being comfortable in my home instead of a laundromat. But realistically, this is not the end-all be-all. As long as you don't expect that, you are going to be very happy. I knew buying this that I'm still going to have to go to the laundromat for my comforter and big items, and I'm fine with that.<br /><br />The spin cycle truly is amazing and wrings out your clothes 90%. But this is not a heated dryer. For some reason, portable dryers are twice this cost, but they do exist!<br /><br />For myself being short and not having much strength, I am able to lift this into the bathtub. I suggest surveying your apartment for where you are going to store this first before buying - luckily my small dining room has enough space to store this while not in use.<br /><br />I am lucky that I don't pay water at my complex, which is why I felt I definitely needed to try this, but I have read in reviews that people's water bills do go up with this, so be forewarned.<br /><br />Hope this helps!", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AHVXIUNUEW2BJTWSXVRJYHCBJAAQ", "timestamp": 1601160271879, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": true}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great Machine Overall worth the Buy", "text": "This machine is a very great purchase overall. I really like that its relatively light and easy to carry. The cons with it are not major. First of all, it gravity drains so it must be elevated to drain. I put mine on a little table and put the hose into the tub for easy draining. Not a huge deal but kind of an inconvenience. Also since its semi automatic, you have to manually fill it with water each use which can be a pain if you don't have a hose to fill it. It holds quite a bit of water so definitely invest in a hose of some kind to help if you don't wanna fill a pitcher a million times. The pros are that it actually fits a decent amount of clothes and water. You dont need much soap either, I intially put too much and had to pour water in and rinse a few times to get the suds out. Also, the spinner works very well. After a 5 minute spin the clothes are pretty much dry. It is very easy to use and also pretty quiet.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "The greatest thing since sliced bread.", "text": "I read all of the reviews carefully before making this purchase. the plastic tubing provided is a bit flimsy, for the water inlet and outlet. Also, the inlet tube in no way easily fits any kind of sink reasonably. it doesn't even seem to be made to. Also, this thing is, as advertised, not automatic. The tube must be moved from washer to spinner if you want to rinse your clothes while they spin, which is the best way. Clothes must be moved from the washer to the spinner, in batches. If you're a fussy, whiney, complaining type that thinks you're buying a $1000+ automatic washer & dryer, don't get this. This is a shockingly underpriced &#60;$100 tool that makes non-automatic laundering a total breeze. My apartment has no hookups, and the facilities in my complex are too expensive and unsanitary. The Giantex, which I have dubbed Big Momma, is a lightweight, portable, extremely efficient way to wash, rinse, and wring your clothes so they dry pretty quickly on the rack. You get through batches so quickly that you run out of rack room fast. I had to get an extra rack. The washer portion is spacious, has a working lint filter, and the motor really knows how to go. My clothes get SUUUUUPER clean on this, and i only use 9 minutes on the timer for normal loads. And i mean SUPER clean, and SUPER soft.<br /><br />I used this thing right out of the box because I had done so much research, I didn't even need to read the instructions. I put it up on my kitchen counter next to my sink. I add detergent, pop in clothes, hold the water inlet up to the faucet and seal it with my hand while it fills, (two minutes, max), let it wash, move the wash to the spinner (which RULES. its WAY easier to balance than my stand alone spinner), switch the hose over to the spinner, run the spinner while i send water up to the spinner to let the clothes rinse (just a few seconds of water rinses it all fine), wait till the spin is done, pull the clothes out and hang them. The washer and dryer drains to the same tube. I just put the end of the drainage tube through the handle of the detergent bottle so its pinned in place and water goes into the sink. At some point I plan to go to the hardware store and make an easy little adapter for the hose to my sink, make life even easier. But this thing already makes it easier. If you take care of it, the tubes will last just fine. My unit does not leak at all. Thank goodness no more handwashing clothes, or hand cranking mini washers. Ugh. This is a 1,000 times better. Takes like a week to arrive though, so plan ahead.

I no longer have to go out into the madness of the city to try and find a half decent laundromat to waste time and money on, I can do everything from home, the machine will pay for itself in a month or two.<br /><br /> Don't bother with the \"instruction book\" it comes with. Put enough clothes in to fill the washing tub half way, put in a tablespoon of detergent, and add water via 5 gallon bucket. After adding the first gallon or so, turn the machine to slow, and turn up the timer to 15.<br /><br />Add water until you see a nice \"vortex\" or \"whirlpool\" of water and clothes moving around freely.<br /><br />When it's done, drain and add in the same amount of water, washing it again for 5 minutes to rinse.<br /><br />Then move it on over to the drier, fill up the drying bin, and place the plastic grid in the bin ontop of the clothes.<br /><br />Make sure your middle knob is still set to drain, then turn your spinner to 5 minutes and let it go! (It really helps to keep the machine ontop of the foam that was on the bottom of the unit in the box to keep down vibrations.)<br /><br />After it's done, your clothes will be somewhat damp, but nearly dry. Air dry on a foldable drying rack (for storage convenience) and give it a few hours.<br /><br />Point a boxfan at it if you wanna speed it up.<br /><br />PS customer service is EXCELLENT!

The product is less than 30lbs without clothes or water in it making it easy to lift. So I can keep it in my living room closet and easily take it out to use and yet keep it out of sight/the way when guests are over! Like most people, I set mine up in my shower so it can drain without any mess and it's close to the water faucet for filling. For me a load can carrying 3 pairs jeans and 3 pairs tights as an example. A little detergent goes a long ways too so don't forget or you'll be rinsing your clothes out non-stop! I wouldn't say the machine is loud in washing mode but drying sounds kind of overwhelming when it first starts up so I WOULDN'T recommend it near a sleeping baby. Only maintenance I have between loads is popping out the small lint trap and emptying it (which is located in the washing port NOT the drying one). The dryer also doesn't use heat so it won't crank your energy bill. It just spins out the water and really well actually! The clothes will still be damp coming out but shouldn't be dripping. Giving them a few hours to hang dry afterwards they do completely dry. I look forward to keeping this around as I move/travel in the future knowing it's easily portable and works effectively!", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AFT3B7AI4AVHW4W6IAA46WFNU7GA", "timestamp": 1555631487875, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great Little Basic Machine", "text": "I recently moved from a huge house with a large washer and gas dryer to a very small but very cute little apartment that was built in the 1800s. Since its just me, I thought this machine would be great.  I did a lot of research before purchasing.<br />This little machine has been a godsend.  I watched a LOT of videos on how to use it and Im glad I did because I was READY.<br /><br />1. The instructions are hilariously awful.  At one point it says to spin the Revolution. I was like.. say what? Watch the videos. Its a pretty simple process.<br />2.  The intake hose is useless. It doesnt fit any faucet known to mankind. You will either have to buy an adaptor but my solution was to set it up next to my standing shower and use my shower head. When I first got it I used a bucket of water. Works fantastic.<br />3. You need to put this machine upright to drain it properly. There is no pump to drain the water out. It uses gravity.  I use two long wood boxes I have turned upside down and it works great.<br />4.  You will find that your clothes actually FEEL cleaner. For some reason maybe its the agitator is better, but my clothes smell and seem cleaner and fresher.<br />5.  Ok so LOTS of people run their clothes with a cycle with soap and then drain and then just put it in the spinner. Thats kinda gross, guys. To do a rinse cycle you just drain the tub and refill it and run a little 6 min cycle to drain the dirty wash water off of your clothes. Thats why rinse cycles exist.<br /><br />Honestly you guys.. this thing is a 100 bucks DELIVERED to you.  It works. Its a simple design, which I actually prefer because its less electronic crap to go wrong. For not having to go to the laundromat or to my moms house for 4 hours while she inspects my clothes and comments on my underwear.. its great. I wish they had these when I was living in NY.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "GREAT!", "text": "I bought this little fella about a month ago and love it.<br /><br />I'm and adult and live in an apt. building. The package arrived without revealing the contents inside.<br />The good and bad side of the machine is that it has some DIY features which give you tons of wiggle room. I set this is up in my bathroom, and use a bowl to manually fill it with water. I try to stay on top of washing my stuff and don't let things pile up because the machine can't handle that much. On average I wash a week's worth of clothes (5 shirts, a sweatshirt, sweatpants, 4 pairs of pants, undergarments) This usually takes 2 loads.<br />The spin dry portion can't handle too much, so I end up placing no more than 4 pieces of light clothing in there (think 4 t-shirts or 2 pairs of pants, or 1 light sweatshirt). The one time I overloaded the spinner, the plastic lid got sliced off by something. This was totally my fault, and did not break the machine. I use a drop of detergent, and run the machine twice (6 minutes to wash, 2 minutes to rinse). The clothes come out a bit damp or really damp, depending on the material and spin time. I tend to crack open the window overnight, or put the fan on and it tends to dry fairly quickly, so try to do your laundry in the evening.<br /><br />This has been a huge help in my home, and I haven't been in a laundromat in a month. I washed my towels, though this takes a bit longer and I prefer to do towels and larger items such as bedsheets at the laundromat--which I suspect I'll frequent once every month with a small load.<br />I recommend this machine to anyone who understands the struggle of having to cart a load of laundry 6 blocks, especially in the winter.

I honestly can't explain how much of a difference this machine made in my life. I moved into an apartment in August of 2020 that didn't have washers in it, so I had to go to the laundromat. And every single time, no matter what I did, I had a massive panic attack. I just... couldn't handle the laundromat. So I started avoiding going, so I would double wear clothes. I not infrequently bought new underwear instead of going to the laundromat. Just to illustrate what it was doing to me.<br /><br />Now that I have this machine, I can do my laundry right when I need to and I don't need to have a massive panic attack. I work in a medical clinic, so I'm exposed to a lot of bodily fluids, so being able to do small, frequent loads is really amazing. The spinner gets my clothes so dry that it takes about 6-7 hours for them to be completely dry (regular cotton underwear/shirts. My scrubs take maybe an hour and jeans/towels take longer).<br /><br />I've found the best way to use it is to only do loads that fit entirely into the spinner, so basically half-fill the washer. Too much more than that and the agitator doesn't really get to move the clothes around a bunch.<br /><br />It does leave my tub dirty, but again, cleaning the tub more frequently is nothing compared to the damage the laundromat was doing to my mental health.", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AFZXYFJSM5DIGHCKAJK7KXOK5XQA", "timestamp": 1627943639772, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "LOVE IT!!!", "text": "Love it, love it, love it!!  I actually have a working, nice full size washer and dryer. However, I'm looking for ways to try to stretch my money. No raise this year! I found this washer and spinner and decided to try it. It's cuteness factor caught my eye, but this baby does a great job washing! I have been stunned at how much dirt it gets out of my clothes. I can wash my secretary work clothes when I come home and the water looks like I had been out mud wrestling!! My clothing has never been this clean, even with my full size Maytag!! It is more hands on doing laundry but I control how hot or cold the water is. It's done in roughly 15 minutes, although not large loads. But I'm not daily washing small loads in the Maytag now and not wasting many gallons of water and electricity. The cons are the intake tube is worthless, so I use a small bucket to fill it. It's a gravity drain so it has to be above where you drain it. I use the bathroom counter and drain in the sink. I have been thoroughly pleased with the machine, but I will say if I had to do it over, a pump draining system would be nice so I could set the machine on the ground. I hope this one lasts awhile, but when it does bow out some day, I personally plan to get one with a pump, although I really have no complaints with this workhorse!  I like to hang my clothes outside. The fresh air and sunshine really make the clothes smell good.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "BEST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER SPENT MONEY ON!!!", "text": "OMG! I love this little washer. 11 years of going to the laundrymat and washing by hand in the tub in between trips. I am in love. I stayed up to 2am washing clothes yesterday, the day it came in. Dirty drawers never felt more like christmas. It holds a lot more than I expected. So far I have only used it up to the medium wash line, with the strength of the agitator I am afraid that filling it up to the high line might cause the water to spill out from under the lid. But (1) load washed 2 of my leggings size xl, 2 xl womens shirts, mens long johns, 2 boys school pants, 2 uniform shirts, 3 long footed fleece onsies for the baby, 5 t sirt onsies and about 8 pairs of socks... I probably could have fit a few more onsies in there, but I am still learning what works best as a full load. I even did a load with 1 pair of my husbands jeans (hes 6ft). 1 f his t shirts, a bunch of socks, about 4 onsies and some random socks. This I found since the jeans are heavy, you want to make a light load. I had to take a few onsies out because I felt it was too much strain on the agitator. The spin tub is small and you have to split the load up in 2 to spin dry... but the spin dry is fantastic. It gets so much water out. I swear I almost cried when I saw how clean the clothes came out and how dry they were left from the spin cycle.. NO MORE HAND WASHING AND HAND WRINGING!!! I set the washer on a bench and used the sprayer from my sink to fill up the water. This is a gravity drain tub, so the drain has to be lower than the machine. I use a 50 gallon sterilite storage tub to drain the water into, then dumped it in my bath tub. This is difficult, but I was so excited to use this thing, that I havent really thought through the whole &#34;where am I going to put it&#34; scenario. I think it would work best to get a sturdy storage rack for my bathroom and store it next to the tub, and use my shower sprayer to fill the it. I found the hose to hook it up to your faucet to be useless, didnt fit and its so narrow that it looks like it would take a while to fill that way. The largest wash set to the highest water level says it takes 46L ... dude thats 23 - 2L pepsi bottles.. thats a lot of water.  But anyway.. awesome product.

You simply turn the water on and it sprays into the spin dryer to rinse the clothes while they're spinning.

The water outlet hose did get a little tear in it (probably because its on the bottem) I hot glued it and everything is just fine!<br /><br />Update **** 10/09/17<br />I've had my Giantex Portable Mini Compact Twin Tub for awhile now and I absolutely love it. I wash all of my clothes and my sons clothes in it and have for months now. It works very well and it is very nice. It came with a tube to hook up to a water outlet, but its not big enough and honestly too much work to even bother with. I fill my washer by bucket, which really isn't a big deal at all. It washes for 15 mins on normal or gentle cycle.<br /><br />I've used my Giantex Portable Mini 4 times now. It is pretty decent, it gets things clean. You will definitely need to buy these 5 things separately: 1.) a 3 prong extension cord (the cord on the machine is very short), 2.) an adapter of some sort to hook the water hose up to your sink faucet (the one included does not fit any faucet in my apartment, I bought a chicken baster and cut a hole in the end of it, works sometimes, this part I'm still struggling with), 3.) a little table to set your Giantex on (the draining system is run by gravity), 4.) Lint catcher, ones made for portable washers (the lint is insane). 5.) I purchased a portable dryer (Panda Portable Ventless Cloths Dryer) the spin dry doesn't get the clothes completely dry but it gets them a very good way there so this is optional. Also, something you need to know.. when you unplug the device the system completely drains. I flooded my kitchen because I didn't know this first off. I also flooded my kitchen not realizing the hose wasn't in the bucket when I initially attempted to use it. So PLEASE be more careful than me :/. It is a good device, you are able to wash and spin dry at the same time! I received the package in a good amount of time, it wasn't damaged at all. The device is actually bigger than I expected. I was just able to wash a blanket, 2 towels, 2 pairs of pants, a bunch of socks and undies, and a shirt all in one wash.

Like some normal size machines, this has a small agitator in the bottom of the square compartment and that's what turns. If the inside was round, it would have to work a lot better. You can't do larger loads or larger items like, work coats or insulated coveralls. The spin dry compartment has approximately half the capacity of the wash side. It does get most things very close to dry in only 5 minutes but, be prepared to do a lot more ironing if wrinkles bother you. This machine would definitely be better than the 5 gallon bucket and plunger method. Lol.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Some things to be aware of...", "text": "The machine is compact (meaning small) and can't handle a full load of laundry. Generally speaking, you could probably fit about five or six T-Shirts and a pair of jeans into it. Anything more is too much. The dryer is even smaller than it's washer, and you will most likely only be able to fit *half* your initial load into the dryer at a time (though the spin cycle for the dryer is also half the washer's cycle, so this isn't too much of an issue).<br /><br />Buyers be aware that the dryer is a non-heated spin dryer, so by it's nature it won't be able to get your clothes completely dry. Buying a drying rack or a seperate dryer is almost necessary. I would recommend running the drying cycle twice and then putting your clothes on a rack for a couple of hours. By then they're set to go.<br /><br />The washer possesses a lint catcher, which works, but doesn't work great. You'll find yourself picking lint off your clothes during each wash, but not enough so for it to be considered an inconvenience. (I generally only find lint on a couple of things I put in there, but that's it).<br /><br />The washer drains via gravity, so keeping the dryer on the floor is a no-go unless you have a large bucket to properly drain it with. I personally put mine in the bathtub and allow it to drain that way.<br /><br />Overall, it's a washer that functions, and is great for apartment dwellers who don't want to go to the laundrymat every week, and for the price asked for, it works just fine.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61GUHAr7XAL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61GUHAr7XAL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61GUHAr7XAL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61N2ZAFq8pL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61N2ZAFq8pL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61N2ZAFq8pL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ZaNTDPH1L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ZaNTDPH1L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ZaNTDPH1L.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61hMtOpOvJL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61hMtOpOvJL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61hMtOpOvJL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61pU3f-hCtL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61pU3f-hCtL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61pU3f-hCtL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AEQJCYPB3R6AKJLDWRB764RBWGGQ", "timestamp": 1475693489000, "helpful_vote": 77, "verified_purchase": true}

We placed the machine inside our shower (we have two bathrooms, so one of them is now called the \u201claundry room\u201d). We watched a ton of YouTube videos of other customers for tips. The washer has 6 small (about an inch) agitators to help clothes move around while washing. We run the normal cycle twice (each is 15 mins) for a nice deep clean. The spinner looks very small however, when you place the clothes evenly in the spinner and press down your clothes come out about 75% dry.  As it initially \u201ctakes off\u201d the spinner is loud and does shake a bit but after a few seconds the machine settles and noise and shaking subside. We propped up the machine on bed risers so the machine wouldn\u2019t be sitting in the water.

It seems to clean the clothing quite well. However, there are a couple of complaints that I have about the washer though. First off, the water inlet hose is too short and does not fit on any faucet. Because of this, I have to fill the washer using buckets. Usually I pour in three buckets of water, that is enough to get the water to the medium line. Also, the drain hose is gravity based and does not use a pump motor. So a drain that is lower than the washing machine itself will be necessary for draining. I learned the hard way to *never* fill the water to the high line, because the agitator is so strong in the washing machine that the water will actually start spilling over the seams of the doors. So I consider the medium water line to be the maximum amount that I can put in. I am still learning to figure out the proper amount of laundry detergent to put in the washer. It does not take much detergent to end up with excessive suds, so only a tiny amount of detergent is needed with this machine. I also noticed that the machine arrived with damage to the plastic on the spinner side.

It is all plastic, but it's fine. I used it 2x with multiple loads. I can get a rather large amount, but I don't push it as I don't want to break it.<br /><br />That being said, I can't believe the connection to this thing. You will need an adapter or you will have to use an extendable shower head to fill this machine up. I don't have either. So I had to take the shower head off and fill it up that way. Mind you that is potentially dangerous since it is electric, so be careful and make sure it is not plugged in! Or you can fill it with a bucket of course. Also the directions are disappointing and ridiculous! I wish too it gave options and sizes for the correct adapter. But it has non of that!<br /><br />I can easily lift this myself and when we are ready we could store it just fine. When I want to use the machine I have mine propped up in the tub, on a crate, then I fill it. Prop it up though if you have it in the tub! I haven't been able to go to the hardware store to get an adapter because of all that's been going on, don't want to risk it. So I have to make this work. The spinner works great, but you can't put much inside, but it takes 2 min to spin and I find that the water is drained enough.<br /><br />The other small complaint water does get left somewhere inside, you have to be sure all the water is completely drained. I just tip it over as much as I can to make sure it is drained. then I leave the top open to make sure it is completely dried.<br /><br />Other than that, its a nice little machine i can see using this in an apartment, but it is a little bigger than the smaller ones, so unless you plan to leave it in you bathroom, you will need a place to store it it.

I watched reviews where people bought it for ~$145 dollars in the past, whereas I paid ~$212 for it (included shipping). I did not like the price, considering it was cheaper in the past and other models and brands have comparable products. However, I bought this one due to the abundant rave reviews.<br /><br />Also, shipping was INSANELY long. I think it was a weather related delay, but it said it was going to arrive an entire week before it actually got here. And then it said it was going to arrive on a said day (getting my hope up again), but it ended up coming the next day. Not a big deal, but I have a newborn and had a batch of dirty baby laundry ready that day, so waiting longer than initially quoted was slightly frustrating.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Wash setting is not loud<br />-Fairly large wash capacity<br />-Simple to read knobs (you can read the manual if you are second guessing yourself, but it really is pretty self explanatory)<br />-Easy to operate<br />-Still lighter and easier to move than a regular washer, since this is only 33 pounds. There are even handles/divets/depressions to help you lift it on the side.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Shipping delays<br />-Price<br />-Filling hose is not useful. I just fill it a couple times with 5-6 potfuls of water.<br />-Draining hose is too short. The manual says not to place it near a bathroom or place with lots of water, but it's basically MADE to be put in a bathtub. Unless you rig it or Macgyver something (or use it outside and drain it into the ground), it's basically made to be inside a bathtub. The hose is just not long enough to drain anywhere else, if you don't modify it.<br />-Short electric cord. I had to use an extension cord, as it's so short that if I actually placed it that close to an outlet, the outlet and plug would get soaked in water.<br />-Spinner is -loudish- but I'm not sure I can actually complain about that because a spinner would be loud no matter what, I'd imagine, given the weight of the machine versus the force needed to spin and wring the excess water out.<br /><br />The product itself is a 4/5 stars.<br />But the cost and shipping delays really killed it for me--which may not even be the seller's fault.

Very impressed but there is definitely a learning curve.<br />First where to put it...the bathtub! How to elevate it for drainage...several tries and finally ended up with plastic shoe boxes.

The boxes in the front are great for holding the clothes as you are moving thru the process. I did use some duck tape to connect the hose to my handheld shower hose the I am able to fill washer and use for the rinse spin cycle if I choose.<br />I purchased plastic clips that snap onto my hangers for drying. I put up another shower rod to handle the extra weight. Then just put my fan in the bathroom and everything is dry in the morning or when I get home from work.<br />Once I'm done the shoe boxes stack together and I store any extra stuff in them til the next time.<br />This is a great investment and for me the laundry is more fun and less dread.<br />The pictures show my shoe boxes in action, an addition lint filter available on Amazon, the plastic clips and mesh bags (I have several they stop a lot of the clothes from mingling with each other, part of the learning curve I spoke of earlier).<br />Final note...buy a steamer, very helpful with any wrinkles you need to remove!", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Fmt3v4ClL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Fmt3v4ClL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Fmt3v4ClL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61w2fLfbyhL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61w2fLfbyhL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61w2fLfbyhL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-sqsbc+cL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-sqsbc+cL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-sqsbc+cL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MvmWKdB4L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MvmWKdB4L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MvmWKdB4L.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AEMHVWKV7YYSDCZ7IH3J743WGNAA", "timestamp": 1472344106000, "helpful_vote": 33, "verified_purchase": true}

Like a lot of other people, I got tired of going to the laundromat. Living in the Northeast, the winters can be harsh and I was not looking forward to walking in the snow in order to get my laundry done. I've been thinking about purchasing a portable washer for quite some time now and finally decided to go for it.<br />This little machine is a blessing. It's quick, efficient and it gets the job done.<br />This little machine is quiet. We live in an upstairs apartment and I am always conscience of our downstairs neighbors. I've lived below noisy people before so I know how it feels to hear nothing but noise, coming from upstairs.<br />At first I though the machine was loud. But in talking with the neighbors, they said they can't hear a thing. So I am thinking I am just hyper aware of any noises that might bother the neighbors.<br />I do have to agree with the other reviews, though. The drain hose is too short and the fill hose doesn't fit onto a standard faucet (the fill hose is about the size of a dime). My remedy for that like many others is to use a bucket to fill the washer and drain the water into a 5 gal. bucket. It's a minor inconvenience.<br />Figuring out how much laundry soap to use is difficult. I am still experimenting with that one.<br />The 2nd time that I used this machine, I thought I had somehow broke it. I put the clothes into the spin tub closed the lid and set the timer- Nothing happened. I turned the knob back to zero and set the timer again. Still nothing. So I re-arranged the clothes and tried again, worked like a charm.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Well hello stay at home laundry", "text": "I bought this in conjunction with: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01EGN8EXQ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1 . Here's my take on the whole system. I recently moved to the bay area in California and as some of you may or may not know this entire area is expensive so when I found a nicely priced place with a real backyard I could sit out in the sun and drink beers in I was pretty excited. The only downside: no washer or dryer or any place to put real ones at. I have no desire to sit in laundromats once a week for two hours or have to worry about dirty machines and everything else so I decided i'd look around and after checking things out decided on these two items.<br /><br />The washer: Yeah the hose to the sink doesn't work, it's short and doesn't fit like it should. Others have mentioned ways of getting around it, i think i'll just buy some hosing, a funnel, a few heavy duty rubber bands, some duct tape and call it a day myself. The power cord is also extremely short, get an extension cord. It works for regular day clothing pretty well as long as you don't fill it up, I expect extra wear on the clothing as a result of this machine though. The spin dry gets quite a bit of water out of the clothing but will leave your clothes very very wrinkled so you will be ironing them unless you like looking like your favorite buddy gave you a purple nurple....except you know.....everywhere. Overall pretty happy with it and as long as it lasts two months i'll be good.<br /><br />The dryer: I hated this thing when i first opened it. It doesn't want you to succeed in setting it up. But I didn't want to role play a super soaker so I got fed up and took the wheels off the base to make it easier. I then took the cover and put it over one side and put the rods in through the cover on the other side. After that it wasn't so bad. Take the middle bar of the middle rack out. Your shirts and pants won't hang fully if you don't and it just makes them dry more uneven. If you want to add a bit more space I suggest measuring the length from the sides and buying some PVC pipe or just getting some and cutting it then putting it over the middle side racks. (would work well for underwear and socks) It dries pretty well, expect about an hour or two to get things pretty good and dry depending on how full it is. (side note i haven't done jeans yet so yeah that'll be a while) Mine didn't come with the remote but I guess i'll live with it. Some good frabric softener would help make the clothing less stiff when it's done. I was going to put the wheels back on it after I was done building it but I decided I didn't need them. I mean unless you want to wheel around your laundry all the time because you think you're cool you can just pick it up and move it when it's not needed.<br /><br />As it is i'm happy. I couldn't live in a place where I had to drive to a laundromat every week for very long and I get to pay less for rent! If these machines stay working I've found a decent solution and only have to go once in a while to do big loads or blankets and stuff. (sheets should be fine one at a time in the washer) These things are time consuming and much less fun than just doing laundry but hey I can't complain too much. Best of luck to anyone looking to get away from laundromats like me!", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AGUSDPB6M7E4OHQMIX6T5RHPMHZA", "timestamp": 1472178591000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

This is a GREAT registry item or baby shower gift for anyone expecting who has to leave their house to wash.<br /><br />A couple notes.<br /><br />I live in a Brooklyn apartment that does not have or allow regular laundry in the apartments. This machine uses less water than flushing the toilet so it won't be detected.<br /><br />Noise: i have to have it in my tub because there is no safe elevated place for draining. This makes it kind of loud (imagine being downstairs from 15 min rumbling in a tub). I know other reviewers are saying it's quiet, but consider the space you are in. It DOES make noise. It's not silent. And depending on where you have it will determine how much reverberation there will be. It relies on gravity to drain, so consider where you will be washing and plug access.<br /><br />Dryer: this is not a dryer. It's a spin cycle that \"rings\" the water out. Buy a drying rack. Also keep in mind, unlike a tumble dry, clothes will not come out soft and fluffy. They were rung out and air dried which can be kind of  crispy. Having said that, the spin cycle works excellently.<br /><br />The hose: idk what this is supposed to attach to (because it fits zero sinks) but just use a large pitcher or a rinsaroo to fill it.<br /><br />Remember to rinse lol. Wash cycle will wash your clothes. Then you need to drain it, refill with fresh water to rinse.<br /><br />Weight: for what it is, it's pretty light. I could pick it up and out of the tub right after having a baby. It feels about 40 lbs and has handles on both sides.<br /><br />Size: it's very compact and fits well in my tiny bathroom.", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AGKD3E2NEGY4LFDG6Q2DBSDCUKFQ", "timestamp": 1640656870037, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true}

This Costway device is a little more labor intensive but far superior in every other way, especially since that other machine did a very poor job washing and was much heavier and was very finicky about being level and the spin cycle would often fail due to imbalance of the contents.  With this machine you don't need to elevate it for it to drain as some have suggested, I just set it right in the bathtub and drain it there, there are short legs that keep up it out of the drain water and the power cable in on the high side away from the tub drain in my bathroom, it might not be as wise to use it like that if your tub is oriented the opposite way.  If you're wondering why the spinner his so small it's because it spins extremely fast, it's like an ultra centrifuge!

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great Alternative to the Laundromat", "text": "This little washer is very simple to operate out of the box. Watching a few review videos first will make things very easy & you'll find lots of great hacks & examples of wash loads. I elevate the washer on 2 dining room chairs at the kitchen sink & drain it into a bucket. The filler hose doesn't fit on my faucet, but I have a sprayer hose on my sink, so I use that. I've also used it in the tub, draining it directly into the drain, but this requires lifting it into the tub, which can be tough on your back.<br />The washer doesn't need a lot of soap & my clothes get clean. The spin cycle is AMAZING, leaving your items darn near dried! Be gentle with the lint trap & clean it often. It's also good to rinse & wipe the inside of the machine out once you're finished doing laundry to keep the grime at bay. I like to leave the lids up for a while to let the machine dry out too. I wish the machine was taller & on wheels for easier transport, but I'm going to get a cart for it to solve these issues.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great for Apartments, Cheaper than a Laundry Mat", "text": "Excellent washing machine! It is a great alternative to spending 20+ dollars at a gross laundry mat. I had to buy a new hose and connector to hook it up to my sink. It uses gravity to drain, so I usually hook it up to my kitchen sink and place it on top of a spare coffee table to have, and drain into a five gallon pail I dump down the bathtub drain. It has a surprisingly decent compacity and cleans fairly well. However, it is more of a rinse, so if clothes are especially dirty, a pre-scrub is necessary. It usually takes a couple rinses to get the soap put of your clothes, and you have to be careful about what type of soap you use. I first used a regular liquid detergent and after 10+ rinses the soap was still not out of my clothes. I recommend a low suds, biodegradable camping liquid detergent that you can find at a sporting/outdoor goods store. It rinses out much cleaner. The spin dryer has a much smaller compacity then the washer, so you have to break the load down to dry it. The spin dryer works really well, most clothes are only just damp by the time they come out, which is great because I just use a drying rack and I can hang the clothes overnight and they will be dry in the morning with no puddles on the floor. Overall, this machine is more time consuming, with a smaller load size then a regular dryer, and you have to manually fill and drain multiple times a load, but it is an excellent, cost saving alternative to using a laundry mat.", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AGQ3TOGULTRRLUYORG6TQLJ3LP2Q", "timestamp": 1481500844000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Our clothes just were not getting the good solid cleaning they needed", "text": "Our washer had broke down months ago and we were hand washing EVERYTHING.  We have 5 people in our house.  That is A LOT of laundry. We got so behind on it so it just piled up and piled up.  My husband and I both worked full time and with 3 kids and 5 different schedules, there was no time for us to have someone come and look at our washer to fix it.<br /><br />So this is where Giantex Portable Mini Compact Twin Tub came in.  I was trying to find something and quick. Our clothes just were not getting the good solid cleaning they needed.  I talked to my husband about this one and did some review searching and found this one to be the best.<br /><br />It arrived a few days later and I IMMEDIATLY put it to work.  It is a small tub but can do a decent amount.  The spinning tub is much smaller and you will have to do things in batches (which I was fine with because I was gunna have clean clothes!!!). The water hose to bring water into the tubs doesn't fit onto any faucet we have but we just used a big bucket filled with water to fill up the tub.  I ended up doing about 5 loads or so, which in a regular washing machine would be about two.  OH MY LORD! I was sooooo happy to finally have clean smelling clothes. I felt like a new woman! I will NEVER take clean clothes for granted ever again! lol<br /><br />This exceeded my expectations.  It is even something you could bring with you camping if you have a camper that has access to electricity and a water line of some kind.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Ideal for our motorhome, highly recommended (with instructions)", "text": "We purchased this item a few months ago and have been using it every few days since then.  It is remarkably well built and sturdy.  We have had only two issues with it, both easily handled.  1.  We place it in our shower, and if the shower drain gets blocked and the water level gets above the legs of the washer, it will not operate until the water level is back down.  (I assume this is a safety feature related to the electrical wiring).  2.  Our dark clothes always come out covered in lint so we end up throwing the darks in the dryer at the campground for a couple bucks to get rid of the lint.  Otherwise, this unit is great.  It gets our clothes much cleaner than we ever got at a laundromat or even our home washer (when we had one).<br /><br />The hose that comes with the washer will not fit standard US faucets, but you can easily create an adapter by visiting your local hardware store.  We elected to \"permanently \" install the hose in our shower with a diverter which also gives us an easy way to fill the dog watering containers.<br /><br />Directions that come with the unit are basically incomprehensible, so here is the gist:<br /><br />1.  Place unit in an area such as a shower that has a drain, plug into outlet (should be a GFI protected outlet).<br />2.  Connect one end of water hose to faucet or whatever you have designed, and the other to the left hand water input nozzle (washing side).<br />3.  Make sure center knob is set to Soft or Normal, not Drain.  Turn on the water to the temperature desired.<br />4.  As the water is filling, go ahead and add detergent (liquid is best, not PODS) and your laundry to about 2/3.  Do not overstuff.<br />5. When water is above line of clothing by about 1 inch, turn the wash cycle to the time desired and close lid.<br />6.  When wash cycle is complete, move about half of wet laundry to the right side spinner.  Do not overstuff.  Put the plastic \"cover\" on top of laundry and press down.  Close both spinner lids and set spinner to desired time.<br />7.  Move the hose to the right side spin/rinse nozzle and turn on cold water for about 1 minute, then turn off.  Allow unit to complete spin cycle.  You can repeat this step if needed.<br />8. When spin cycle is complete, remove clothes and hang to dry.  Repeat steps 6&7 for remaining laundry.<br />9.  If you have more laundry to do, you can reuse the existing wash water if it isn't extremely dirty or turn the center knob to drain to empty the basin, then start over at step 3.<br />10. After a couple loads, be sure to remove and clean the lint trap inside the wash basin.  When complete and basins are empty, set the center knob back to normal, unplug the unit, disconnect the water hose and store it wherever you desire.<br /><br />Hope this helps.", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AH4YZYDQBRL7I7L3OTNDCQ7GEXTQ", "timestamp": 1556922965997, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "It works but not as much as I need it to", "text": "My boyfriend and I our moving to a new place soon where there is no washer/dryer on-sight. We bought this to try it out to see if we need to change our future living situation. I was excited to give this a try and hoped that it worked as well as a lot of people said it had. I was disappointed. Having to do smaller loads in the first place is inconvenient, and then only being able to put 1/2 of the load in the spin dryer (meaning you have to run the drying cycle twice, then back in the washing side to rinse, than again another two runs of drying). None of the cycles take very long but having to move things around and start new cycles every few minutes just makes it take a while. It probably took me an hour and a half to get set up and just do one load. This was my first time using it so it might be quicker next time, but it's really important to have a set up of hosing the water in and having a place for the water to drain. Bucketing water in and out is very tiring and annoying. My boyfriend works in a restaurant and his work clothes gather quite a stench, and our normal washer would get the smell out just fine. This however, did not. It helped, but I didn't feel it got the clothes quite clean enough, they still smelled slightly. This probably means I would need to do even smaller loads. Which again, leads to the frustration and time of the numerous cycles and putting in/draining water. I was really hoping this would work a bit better and be a bit more convenient. This would be good for just the occasional small load, and is much more convenient than a laundromat, but maybe not the best option for all of your laundry, all the time. It works and does what it advertises, it just wasn't what I was looking for.", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AFCE7F7NOTBJYB6JWGUZUSQEFYOQ", "timestamp": 1553357788480, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "I hate laundry; but it\u2019s my Best Purchase in Years.", "text": "So I try to spend a minimal amount money. I tend to be a bit frugal; but it\u2019s by choice and I\u2019m lucky for that. So I saw the price tag and I was \u201cwishy washy\u201d (ha, get it?!) about getting this machine.<br /><br />We have a laundry mat down the street but it\u2019s SUCH A HASSEL! dragging it in and out and waiting for machines; it takes so long. And it\u2019s a ton of stupid quarters and public people. It\u2019s annoying and a pest to do constantly. But the idea of making a big chore into a mini chore was appealing. I wash in my work form home breaks which I\u2019m done switching and start washing within 3-4 minutes.<br /><br />So I was skeptical of this machine to be honest. If it\u2019s from Amazon how nice is it really? I saw good reviews and praised; and I took a risk. And I\u2019m SO GLAD I DID!<br /><br />pros. This machine is lightweight; compact but still pretty nice sized. I was shocked when it came in how big it is.  It\u2019s just me and my fianc\u00e9 and two cats; we have a queen sized bed and don\u2019t do much. So this machine is PERFECT! It can wash towels, sheets, slippers, all work clothes (including his khakis and my thick sweaters)! Big comforters might be able to fit but an occasional blanket washing trip is better than every week!<br /><br />Pull out of the box and unwrap, and plug in. The easiest setup of my life. I was worried getting a machine online I thought it would be more complicated. But nope. Easy peasy :)<br /><br /> Now you do have to be a little careful loading it; if it\u2019s not fully whirlpooling it won\u2019t clean it right. Also; SOAP. One tide pod was too much so we unfortunately did have to switch to tide liquid. But it just needs a small \u201cbloop\u201d of soap. It can get over soapy easy so just use maybe 1-2 tablespoons. That\u2019s the sweet spot.<br /><br />The spinner (not dryer) is very fast. It\u2019s actually fun hah! It actually gets clothes like 70-80% dry. At first I was wary: I knew this might be an annoyance. But drying clothes takes maybe 3-4 hours? It\u2019s not long to let it hang and air dry it\u2019s honestly been nice to have our house smell good!<br /><br />This is the first time I ever have enjoyed doing laundry. Ever. That\u2019s massive for me! It used to be so annoying and my least favorite thing ever but now it\u2019s nice to see my clothes CLEAN! And fresh. :)<br /><br />We don\u2019t have any hookups (but they are built in on the washer!) so tbh I got 4 cinderblocks and a 5 gallon pail (it\u2019s a gravity drain) to hoist it up; and the 5 gallon pail is ok with my bad shoulder even when full. She isn\u2019t stunningly gorgeous on her cement throne but hey, it works well and it\u2019s sturdy. And it cost under $6.<br /><br />Cons: this is a spinner so you do have clothes around the house. Be mindful of that. I wish it was a dryer but it\u2019s a super good spinner honestly; doesn\u2019t need to air dry long. Not a con for me but for others maybe.<br /><br />If you don\u2019t have hookups you will need a shower or bucket for water. I don\u2019t mind this at all (featuring cottagecore lil old me) but I know that can be upsetting to some.<br /><br />This machine is a little loud when spinning. Even if you balance it right it just whirrs. Now it\u2019s not extremely distracting or bad. But it\u2019s something that\u2019s there.<br /><br />No full lines on the wash tub. It takes some experimenting but it is a lot better once you figure it out.<br /><br />And weird instructions. Don\u2019t even read those just chuck em. It barely made sense.<br /><br />TDLR: best money ever spent. Made me fall in love with doing laundry which I normally hate. Best purchase in a very long time and holds up well.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Just out of box, 3 loads done in about 1.5 hours", "text": "I just got this yesterday and set it up this morning with first three loads completed. It took me about 1.5 hours, but expect it will go quicker once I get the correct hose hook ups. As pretty much every other review has said, the inlet hose that comes with this doesn't work out of the box. Since I did my research, I wasn't surprised or disappointed with this. Totally expected it. Before I used it this morning, I did watch quite a few of the video reviews - Kayley had a great one (but she used a whole tide pod which I think is too much soap). Pleasantly surprised that you can rinse your close in the spin side! I was able to wash quite a lot of clothes in each load, including adding a pair of jeans in with a few t-shirts and heavy socks AND a mid weight sweater. The amount of clothes I washed in the three loads this morning is about the same as I would have put in one of the jumbo washers at the laundromat.  I did elevate the machine, but didn't have anything to put it on so the machine was completely above the side of the tub for full draining, so after all draining was completed, I put the hose in a bucket that was on the floor for the last bits.<br />I was astonished at the amount of dirt / stuff that came out of the clothes - even with the very small amount of soap I used.<br />Things that would have made this machine better: (1) longer inlet hose (2) slightly longer power cord (3)information as to what adapter I could purchase at the same time - even if it didn't come with it, at least I could link to it and purchase it also.<br />To me, the pros far outweigh any of the cons for this machine. I'm hoping I will get many years work out of this.<br /><br />Update: Since getting this machine, I have washed everything in it except very large items. Heavy jeans, thick bath size towels, sweaters - even shaggy fur fabric. Surprising how much I could put in each load. For example: heavy winter jeans, thick knit sweater, 2-3 long sleeve t-shirts, few under things all in one load. As reviews and description states - 1/2 wash load fits in spinner at a time. Even the heavy items spun out well - better than any commercial washing machine has done lately. For rinsing, I used about 1 Tablespoon white distilled vinegar in a gallon of water poured into the spin side...AFTER spinning all wash water out of it. Give the clothes a really good shake to remove wrinkles an hang to dry what little moisture is left in them.<br />UPDATE: I have now been using this machine 1-2 times a week and I am just as happy with it as when I bought it 6 months ago. I wash jeans, jackets, sweaters as well as lighter material with no problems. I do have to say, I have had to remove an item or two because I put too much in occasionally but that is not the machine's issue. If you are looking for a good way to hook the hose up to the sink/shower, I highly recommend the Rinseroo system.

I live in a cheap apartment with no washer or dryer and the ones at the on site laundry are from the 70s and this was a perfect solution. I no longer have to drag my laundry up and down 2 flights of stairs or pay $5 a load for washing and drying.

I purchased a large drying rack from Amazon and took off one of the collapsible racks and added a bungee cord it works perfect for moving it around my apartment.

Mine did and I didn\u2019t have to buy any hardware and there\u2019s no leaks. You might wanna super glue the plastic cone in the intake tube in though it comes out sometimes.<br />Make sure to do your own rinse cycle.

A heated hang-dryer works well with this washer - we've liked the &#34;Panda&#34; brand one. Overall, this product is so much easier than going to a laundromat and cheaper than a full-size unit. The key is to do small loads frequently and not let the wash pile up; the tub won't hold nearly as much as a full-size washer so if you wait too long, getting caught up will take some time.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Love this perfect and reliable washing machine!", "text": "This is a perfect and reliable laundry machine. The machine is only for washing and wringing, and it requires manual hanging to dry. These machines usually expect smaller loads so overloading will burn out the agitator. I bought another machine first (rating was 4/5, less than $100) but that unit broke on the 2nd usage due to the agitator stopped working without any obvious overloads. This unit was my 2nd purchase and so far, it's working great. Thus, even user's careful attention, these machines may have hit and miss in QA standard even within the same unit. Here are some important usage tips (from my experience with this unit) and data:<br /><br />Data (load examples below are only for your baseline, to adjust with your further fine-tuning):<br />* Usage period - 4 months since the purchase, still working great<br />* Usage frequency - 2 to 4 loads per week (all loads done in 1 day, not spread over days)<br />* comfortable load example #1 - 1 flat sheet and 1 fitted sheet (full), 1 bath-towel (thick), plus a few kitchen towels<br />* comfortable load example #2 - 2 pairs of women's jeans (regular size 2), 3 women's inner long-sleeve shirts (size S, t-shirt or thinner material, not sweatshirts), plus a few undies and socks<br /><br />Important usage tips (in-parentheses):<br />1. Put the machine in a bathtub<br />2. Lay the drain hose down close to the bathtub drain (if you forget to put the hose down from the hanging position, spin will not work. It will spin very slow)<br />3. Plug it in<br />4. Set the dial to Soft or Normal (Make sure the dial is NOT SET to \"Drain\" before step #5)<br />5. Put 2/3 water in the machine (I use a 3-gallon bucket)<br />6. Put liquid detergent (recommended)<br />7. Put the load in the water and adjust the final amount (DO NOT FILL UP. Leave at least 3 to 4 inches from the top)<br />8. Wash for 15 min (or less if you prefer. DO NOT DRAIN the water yet. The weight of the water helps the machine stabilize for the spin cycle below)<br />9. Spin the load for 1.5min (to wring out the soapy water)<br />10. Drain soapy water from the washer and then put clean water for the rinse cycle<br />11. Put the wrung load back from the spinner to the washer, then adjust water level<br />12. Rinse 9 min (or less or more if preferred. Again, DO NOT DRAIN the water after this step, to balance/stabilize the machine for the spin cycle below)<br />13. Spin 3 min and take the load out of the spinner (anytime after this point, drain the water from the washer, make sure water is completely drained from the drain hose, then unplug/put away the machine)<br />14.

The rinse/spin dry side took a minute to figure out but once I did it was easy. I run water on the \"dryer\" side during it's first spin, to rinse out extra soap, and then run it a second to spin out excess water. Obviously things don't come out completely dry, but enough that it only takes a couple of hours for it to finish drying by hanging. I will say the instructions were not properly translated, very hard to understand, but I figured it out.

Drain, then back to the spin tub for 5 or 6 min.  The clothes come out clean and nearly dry!  I use a small folding drying rack, which easily holds two of the  1/2-sized loads.

This is a powerful/aggressive little washer!  It definitely has gotten our clothes clean, but it has also damaged the fibers in clothing. The damage appears to be from the spin dry tub (the drainage holes are a little sharp on the edges). My solution was to put wet clothes inside a pillowcase. Worked like a charm and the clothes come out with less or much \"softer\" wrinkles.  Before the pillowcase fix,  it took the rear label patch off of a pair of men's Levi jeans and created pulls in the fabric of a dress shirt that was otherwise in like new condition. The lint filter does a fairly lousy job of catching all of the lint as I still get a considerable amount on clothing after it comes out of the spin cycle.  I add a cup of vinegar to the wash cycle because we have hard water and to help cut the suds.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Does what it\u2019s supposed to do.", "text": "[[VIDEOID:b669cd683727f7181ef3bc53e7d435c0]] This washer is great! It does what it\u2019s supposed to do. It\u2019s small compared to regular washers but this is easy to set up and you can get straight to tackling your laundry load. I tried washing by hand and it\u2019s a no for me. I used to walk to the laundry mat across the street but it was way too tedious. Unfortunately my apartment\u2019s laundry room is not reliable so this was the best option for me.<br /><br />Pros: It\u2019s easy to set up even if the hose doesn\u2019t fit, you can always fill it manually so that\u2019s not going to stop you from washing.<br /><br />Good for apartments (small spaces) where your not allowed to hook up a machine.<br /><br />Great for washing every day clothing. Shirts, shorts, pajamas, underwear, socks, towels, small rugs and bath towels.<br /><br />It washes everything really well. I noticed it washed better than at my local laundry mat (not sure why).<br /><br />Spinner dries clothes about 60-70%, you don\u2019t need to struggle wringing anything out.<br /><br />It doesn\u2019t take long to wash 15 minutes max to wash and to dry another 5 or less. Longest wash and spin under 20 minutes.<br /><br />You will save so much money not only on soap because you only need a tiny amount but also from going to a laundromat.<br /><br />Cons: You can\u2019t wash big heavy items like blankets, heavy coats/jackets.<br /><br />You have to set it up in a way that it won\u2019t shake/vibrate too hard. When it spins specifically in the beginning it spins hard then it gets the motion shaking stops. When ending the spin cycle shakes again.<br /><br />Can\u2019t fill the tank with too many clothing items. You\u2019ll will be washing few articles at a time. For example 2-3 shirts, a pair of pants/shorts, and few underwear/socks per wash. (5-8 items with 2 heavy the rest light).<br /><br />You need to be careful not to load it or it can damage the machine. I\u2019m always checking how it spins before I leave it to wash. If it doesn\u2019t spin it\u2019s overloaded so you need to take some clothes out so it can wash well.<br /><br />Overall the pros outweigh the cons for me. It\u2019s made a big difference. To be able to wash at home without a hassle so worth it. It\u2019s a good investment only $200 dollars! Totally worth it, I enjoy using my machine for the past 2 weeks since it arrived. I thought about it so long and I\u2019m glad I finally bought it.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Great solution to apt living. Takes more work thatn a regular machine.", "text": "My original Review was when this machine was working. Ive used the machine a hand full of times since I bought it in March. It is now august and It doesnt work anymore. Neither the wash basin or the spinner work. I took great care not to over load and the motor already burnt out. It seems like a great solution but... its not. Its a short term one.<br /><br />I have used this washing machine for about 2 months now and for the size and money it does a great job. If you are looking for a easy time doing laundry this is not for you. It takes more work than a regular washing machine. This is my process. You need to add the clothes, fill with either a bucket or a detachable shower head. The hose that comes with it is useless so just throw it away. I have been using my detachable shower head and that works just fine. I add detergent to the line that says 1 on the cap.  I set the timer for 15 min. Let it do its thing. Then I drain it in to the tub. Make sure your machine is up higher than the tub. I use 2 chairs in the bathroom to prop it up so i get good drainage. It works on gravity alone. There is no pump.  I recommend getting a lint trap to attach to the hose or you are going to be cleaning your tub a lot. The lint trap in the machine doesn't work very well. Once I drain, I fill the basin again and run for like 10 min with regular clean water. Drain that and this part is optional but I like to fill it again and add fabric softer to the last rinse and run it for like 5 min and then drain it. To use the spinner the less clothes the better. If you over load it it will not spin right. So if you are spinning jeans then do one pant at a time. The spinner does a great at getting the water out of the clothes. I find that at most, 3 min spin time is good to get water out of heavier clothes and for shirts or leggings one min is plenty.  In one load I'm able to wash about 7 medium shirts. Id say you could wash 3 pairs of jeans in one load. If they are of average size. Larger clothes take more room obv. The heavier the clothes the harder the machines works to move the clothes around. The first few washes the machine emits a mechanical grease type smell. The more you use the machine the more the smell dissipates. It does not affect your clothes what so ever. Make sure to always reset the drain dial to wash mode or else you will get water in to the spin compartment while the clothes wash... its not a big deal. Once you drain, the water will drain out of there too. Id recommend being gentile with this machine because the hose used to drain is kind of flimsy. Hence the 4 stars instead of 5 star rating. I'm scared that it will rip at some point and get water everywhere. I want to replace it with a sturdier hose at some point. The machine isn't perfect. It leaves a bit of lint on clothes. Especially black clothes and if you have cats or dogs... you are going to want to either use a lint roller after the clothes has dried or just don't use this at all. I line dry all my clothes. It will be dry with in 2 hrs if i put a fan in the bathroom. Over all. I'm pretty content with this machine for what its worth. The time I can spend at home is worth more to me than lugging 2 weeks worth of clothes to the laundromat and spending 3 hrs there with whiny kids with no entertainment. Now I only have to go once a month to the laundromat for my linens only. Although I do use this to wash my towels.<br />I live in an apt with spotty laundry access so to  me this machine was the answer to my problems.", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AEBTAZG5DKY7NLHFOYCTHP5FJSCA", "timestamp": 1491238738000, "helpful_vote": 25, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Lots of potential in a little machine", "text": "My wife is absolutely pleased with her tiny washer. She washes, sometimes, twice a week with no problem except for the issues of either carrying water to the machine or constantly going back and forth to the kitchen sink to turn the water on and off and monitoring the water level or the hose dangling inside the machine making sure it hasn\u2019t slipped out onto the floor. This is for the wash, rinse, and spin cycles. Other than that, we don\u2019t have any problems with leaks or anything else. I thought about making this machine capable to semi-automatically fill itself. I\u2019m pretty resourceful, I made life a lot better for both of us, and now, she\u2019s even happier. Check out the picture and see how I did it. If this setup is too much or complicated, the easier way is to just run a simple single hose to the machine and put one valve on it, then add another piece of hose to hang inside the machine. Once you have the hose hanging inside the machine, you can use a simple clamp, like the one shown or similar, and clamp it to the rim of the tub. You can also slip the hose onto the nipples, one at a time, on top of the machine.<br /><br />Hose specs: Hose from sink should be \u00bd\u201d ID \u215d\u201d OD<br />This hose type can be used for most of the plumbing project. Even for the valves.<br /><br />Hose specs: Hose going to the inlet nipples on top of the machine should be \u215d\u201d ID  \u00be\u201d OD. This piece can be about 8\u201d in length.<br /><br />ID is inner diameter<br />OD is outer diameter<br /><br />Any associate at any hardware store can help you with these parts.<br /><br />Once you have all the hoses and valves connected, you can just slip the hose from the sink inside the hose attached to the top of the machine. Make sure to push the hose in far enough so the pressure will not push them apart. I do suggest you use hose clamps to attach the hose to the nipples on the machine, since they will be staying in place and because of the possible pressure.<br /><br />The valves can be any valves of your choice. The can be either brass or plastic.<br /><br />This setup will give you the freedom, peace, and ease to fill your machine constantly and turn your water off right there whenever you don\u2019t need it.<br /><br />We have ours in our bedroom near the door, not just for storage, but full time. We just hang the hose out the door to drain, since it just \u201cgray\u201d water.

It\u2019s very easy to use. I read other reviews for instructions the ones that come with the washer are pretty useless. The small hose it comes with also pretty useless. We live in an apartment.<br /><br />1) This machine drains with gravity. I put it on top of some milk crates next to bathtub. Its perfect.<br /><br />2) I have it in the restroom right next to bathtub and I use a detachable shower head to fill it up. Its way easier than adding all these hoses or using buckets.<br /><br />3) very little soap goes a long way. Yes it really does. The loads are small. No just like 3 things more like 4 pairs of tights 2 shirts and a pair of shorts. Works perfect!<br /><br />4) Do not fill up washer too much with the movements it will spill from top.<br /><br />5) The spinning cycle is not a dryer! But it leaves clothes completely water free. They will air dry in about an hr or 2 max! Just make sure to put in half of the wash load. Load it correctly and it should do its magic.<br /><br />6) I attached some plastic snares (2) on the drain hose just to catch lint and other things. So they wont go down the drain and clog up my bathtub. I bought a 14 pack for about 5$..<br /><br />7) After each use I rinse everything with hot water both washer and spinner. Clean out lint trap. And leave the tops open so it wont smell.<br /><br />8) Its not super loud it has a slight humming when it washes but other than that its perfect!<br /><br />Bottom line is yes purchase it.

I fill it up with buckets- was unable to rig the hose, but honestly it's not a huge deal. The agitator is strong. Don't expect this to be comparable to an industrial machine- I still sprayed spots with laundry spray that I know a regular washer would get out. Our laundromat shut down due to Covid and we were in a bind. This little baby has handled about 10-15 loads so far and is still twerkin. The spin compartment is plenty powerful. Expect to hang dry everything, so choose how much you'll do at once based on the amount of drying space you have. We use a laundry rack, our radiators, and hang some pieces up around the apartment on hangers. We have limited space and this guy fits in our entryway. You could also store things inside when you are not using it.<br /><br />Dislike: The lint situation can be a bit overwhelming... make sure you clean the trap as much as possible. Make sure you do some rinse cycles and properly rinse the clothing.<br /><br />Not something to dislike but of note: The spin dry can't handle the entire load so you'll have to experiment and see what it can handle and do it in stages. It's usually gotten all the juice out in 3 minutes, so there's not much lag time if you're hang drying anyway.<br /><br />Bonus: When doing bras, do a small separate load and put each bra in a laundry bag. Then put the laundry bags in the spin cycle instead of hanging to dry immediately. This will get out excess water and make your bras dry quickly.<br /><br />All in all: This isn't sturdy construction and a lifelong machine most likely. It's made of cheap materials, but it gets the job done if you're in a bind. It's also great for delicates. Watch some youtube videos before using.

However, this device is one of the most practical small washer devices I have ever seen. For the hundred or so bucks what you have is a simple, washing and spin extractor system that leaves your garments rrady to hang on a line ( or shove in a dryer) with minimal fuss. The water inlets are on both sides of the top panel, the drain is on the bottom and is controlled at the panel as well. We are off grid and needed a system that was easy to adapt. This was it. The washer side is built with a bottom plate agitator to spin the washables, alternating clockwise for 20 or so seconds then Counter clockwise. Both washer duration and extractor duration is set with mechanical timers on the front panel. So is drain. With the small motor it is still adequate to run about 12 lbs of clothes, and about half that in the extractor which needs to be loaded carefully so as not to become off balances. We run it from a small generator and manually load water, dumping into a couple of buckets for reuse processing. This device is a godsend for folks like us. Especially with small footprint of 24\u201d wide by 14\u201d deep. Easy to move, as it is all plastic, but what the heck.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "I'm glad I bought it", "text": "I ordered this 5 months into the pandemic when I was tired of hand washing my clothes, sheets and towels and wasn't comfortable going to a public laundromat.  This machine is like the missing link between hand washing and a regular full sized washer. I have it up on two plastic crates, next to my bath so it can drain into the tub. I was lucky that my shower sprayer reaches the washer to fill it and I don't have to hook and unhook the hose to the shower spigot. I did have to buy an extension cord rated for washers to reach my outlet. It's more hands-on than a regular washer, you need to switch the laundry from washer side to spin side, then back to washer to rinse, then back to spin side to semi dry it. So I've just taken to doing one function every time I pass the bathroom. It fits a surprising amount of sheets, towels, clothes. I have washed a cotton bedspread with no problem. The only things that don't fit are large comforters and pillows. It has a vigorous wash cycle and the spin cycle gets items almost dry. The tiny filter inside doesn't catch all the lint, so I attached a foot cut from a stocking to the drain hose with a rubber band to catch the rest. This was a great purchase and after a year and a half it's still going strong<br />EDIT- At just a couple weeks short of 2 years of owning this machine I was washing a couple of loads of laundry when I smelled a horrible burning smell. There was gray smoke coming from the top of the machine and the machine no longer works so I guess the motor burned out. I was starting the 3rd load in a row which I have done plenty of times before, so I'm not sure what went wrong. I'm not sure I'll repurchase this because the price has gone up and I regretted not paying a little more originally for a machine where you don't have to switch the laundry back and forth from compartment to compartment", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AFQZJL3JA62JNDA6HE6VLLTMZ3MQ", "timestamp": 1643777713349, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Wonderful but some small things", "text": "First I just want to say that this really is a good machine. It works wonderfully for washing clothes (albeit in small loads which is fine) and for spinning out the water. My main complaint is the condition (and one small misleading description) which I will get to .<br /><br />I love that this machine is small and easy to move around. The sound I would say is no different than a medium noise level dishwasher however the spin cycle will be loud at first.<br />Looking at this machine at first glance it seems relatively easy to handle and use but watching another person's video on how they use this greatly helps just make it easier to jump in and use.<br /><br />Now to what complaint.<br />I got this machine yesterday and was super excited!<br />However when I opened the box (which machine was upsidedown) I instantly noticed how gross the feet were. I kept unboxing though and noticed that the main part being the washing and spinning bins hadn't looked used. Wrapping was on the lids for protection, warning of moving parts sticker was still on the spin cycle lid...So today I decided to use it anyways cause ya know.....laundry. but whenever I moved the machine to drain the water\u2014don't have anything to set this on yet for gravity drain so I moved it to the tub to drain.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great little machine to help you stay home!!!", "text": "This little machine is a lifesaver during the corono virus so I do not have to leave the house.  A great buy. There is certainly a learning curve in how to use it. As far as noise level.  It is a little noisy when spin cycle first starts.  If you are in an apartment I suggest putting a rubber mat under it to absorb noise.<br /><br />I  just put it near my shower stall and fill it up from the hose showerhead and let it drain after the wash cycle  into the bottom of the shower.  I put mine  on a wheeled cart. Cost 77 bucks but well worth it as it is very sturdy and easily wheels the washer to closet for storage when I am done.<br /><br />Some advice:<br /><br />1. If you fill it too much you will notice machine struggles to swish clothes around.<br />Makes a chug chug sound. Next time don't fill so much.<br /><br />2.  Only little bit of soap. If you put too much on it will be filled with soap suds after draining.<br /><br />3. I fill machine again with water after initial washing for a rince cycle.  If you put too much soap in you will have to do two rinses.<br /><br />4. I struggled with how much water to fill up for a wash.  I fill it up to the top of the vertical lines that are on the inside wall.  Don't worry about putting to much water in as you will notice it will start draining out. Also, if you put the shower head in washer to fill it up and walk away to do something else and forget about it , it will not overflow onto the floor,  instead it will drain into the shower.<br /><br />The cart it is on: Magna Cart platform 300 lb capacity. The washer fits on it nice but I put some sponge material under each corner to prevent it from moving around during spin cycle.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that the piece you put on top of clothes in the spinner is clear and I often don't realize it remains on the bottom of the spinner after last use.  I then have to remove the clothes to retrieve it.  It would help immensely if the piece of plastic was colored so it could be seen more easily. For this reason I give the machine 4 stars.<br /><br />I am 77 years old and this is the longest review I have ever done but I wanted to help someone else out during this very difficult time of Coronivirus.

This works wonderfully for small frequent loads and it is FAST.

It wasn\u2019t too loud for sleeping babies in the next room either and saved me a lot of time.<br /><br />February 2019: I did a lot of homework before selecting this machine, read reviews, watched videos, compared models, all for not apparently. I\u2019m not sure if my machine was just defective but when running it leaked all the water I had put in it out onto the floor from the back panel. At rest, it did not leak. The water level was not past the fill line, this was a test run so barely a quarter of the tub was filled.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Improved My Quality of Life - Extremely Satisfied", "text": "This review is for the skeptics - because I was one. I went back and forth about buying this machine for MONTHS, all while dragging my clothes to a laundromat. I worried that I would be wasting my money on this machine and that the reviews were too good to be true. I was worried that it would would flood my floor and downstairs neighbor. I was worried that it would be heavy and hard to use.<br /><br />Well, fellow skeptics - I am here to admit I was wrong. I LOVE THIS MACHINE.<br /><br />Within 2 weeks I feel that I\u2019ve already gotten my money\u2019s worth. I have been able to wash towels, sheets, a queen duvet cover, tons of clothing, delicate work shirts, and more. And let me tell you, they have come out SO  CLEAN.<br /><br />And while the machine doesn\u2019t have a dryer, the spinner is far more powerful than I expected. The items come out barely damp and only need to hang dry for a little while before I can fold and put them away.<br /><br />My tips:<br />I use the machine in the shower / bathtub. I fill it up with my detachable shower head until it\u2019s at a good level (see inside for H/M/L aka High, Medium, Low) to know where to fill to. I then add a small amount of detergent, add the clothes, and walk away! After wash one, I drain, sometimes spin the clothes, refill, wash again and spin.<br /><br />Some things you should know:<br />1) do NOT use too much soap. A little goes a long way. Just a splash of liquid detergent does the trick<br /><br />2) the customer service is excellent. I will not lie, I had an issue with the first machine I ordered (it leaked). I emailed customer service and they sent me a new machine insanely fast. I felt like I was in good hands.<br /><br />Still thinking about getting the machine? This is your sign!

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Some workarounds for a good product!", "text": "[[ASIN:B01ALBMIEI Giantex Portable Mini Compact Twin Tub 11lb Washing Machine Washer Spin Dryer]]<br /><br />I've been using my Giantex portable washing machine for two weeks and I have a couple of thoughts for people who are considering purchase of this machine.<br /><br />1) I gave this product 4 stars for the following reasons:<br /><br />  * The input hose could not be attached to my bathroom faucet (as others have noted).<br />  * Water leaked out of the top seam of the washer tub when using the normal setting with a large load.<br /><br />2) Draining the machine.<br /><br />I did not buy a machine with a built in pump because I thought that would be one more thing that could break.  However, if a siphon will not work for you, it is worth the money to buy a slightly more expensive machine that has a built in pump that will allow you to drain into a sink.<br /><br />Some people solved the drainage problem by putting the machine on a platform or in a shower/tub.  I had concerns about that because when the spinner is not balanced, it moves the machine around (which could cause the machine to fall off a platform) and because I felt nervous about having an electrical connection where water may puddle.  I decided to place my washing machine on the floor of my bathroom.  It is about 3 feet from one bathroom sink and about 3 feet from my tub.<br /><br />I looked into buying an electric powered pump to drain the water (as another customer had noted).  However, since that customer did not name the pump he bought, I spent time time researching pumps before deciding that most of them were either too expensive or didn't fit the configuration of pulling water from inside the washing machine's drainage hose as I wanted to do.<br /><br />Because the drainage hose is about 2 inches about the floor, I thought that a siphon might work for me.  For a test, I bought some cheap aquarium tubing and the siphon action worked.  So, I bought a Plumber's Siphon Pro (on Amazon) for $13.49, and it works great.  With the drain hose hooked vertically on the machine, I drop the weighted end of the siphon down to the bottom of the drain hose, pump the siphon bulb until the hose if full, and drop the end of the siphon hose into the tub drain, and the water starts draining.<br /><br />3) Water input.<br /><br />I considered replacing my shower head with a three way shower diverter, but decided against it because I do not need a hand held shower head.  I also had some doubts about having to modify a shower head to allow a stronger water flow.<br /><br />My solution was to connect a garden hose to one of my bathroom faucets.  This is what I bought:<br />  * Home Depot - &#34;15/16 in.-27M / 5/64 in.-27F x 3/4 in. GHTM or 55/64 in.-27M Chrome Multi Thread Garden Hose Aerator Adapter&#34; ($5.02 - shipped to store for pickup)<br />  * Amazon - &#34;American Specialty UT-10 10' Multi-Purpose Utility Hose&#34; ($12.12).<br /><br />I connect the utility hose to my sink faucet when I want to wash.  It takes a few minutes to fill the wash tub.  I put the end of the hose in my tub between wash and rinse cycles, and disconnect it when I am done washing.  Also, don't leave the room when the wash tub is filling as the hose may fall out of the wash tub, and then yikes!!! what a mess.<br /><br />4) Solution for water leaks on the top seam  -  Set the setting to &#34;Soft&#34; and fill no higher than the medium setting.<br /><br />5) Solution for clothes tangling - Use laundry mesh bags to separate shirts and dainties in the wash tub (but take the clothes out of the bags when spin drying).<br /><br />6) Solutions for out of balance spinner - Fold shirts, pants before putting them in the spinner tub.  Don't overload the spinner tub.<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy with this portable washing machine.  I don't have to spend $10-$15 each week at the laundry mat.  It's just me and my husband, so I can do small loads whenever I want.  And my clothes get just as clean as at the laundry mat.<br /><br />07-05-2016 Someone asked for pictures of my siphon setup.  The first picture shows how far down the weighted end of the siphon hose will go inside the drainage hose (down to where the water exits the machine).  The second picture shows the weighted end of the siphon hose inside the drainage hose.  The third picture shows the water draining into the tub's drain.  (Note the small strainer I bought at Walmart to catch any lint.)  The fourth picture shows how the siphon hose snakes up the side of the tub and over into the tub.  Once the water starts flowing, the suction is strong enough to pull water until there is no more water at the weighted siphon end.  (Note the black siphon pump should be removed from the hose after the hose is filled with water.)", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/618f1LYu2aL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/618f1LYu2aL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/618f1LYu2aL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61IbOuSl9wL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61IbOuSl9wL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61IbOuSl9wL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71l7pnMJ5kL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71l7pnMJ5kL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71l7pnMJ5kL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71svGOYCVrL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71svGOYCVrL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71svGOYCVrL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AHD3GUKS5W2IVNLGIFK7CANCB3WA", "timestamp": 1466555523000, "helpful_vote": 60, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "SO FAR SO GREAT!", "text": "Update 11/2018: still loving my portable washer after a year!! Tips: I've learned to wash once, drain water. Fill with clean water, then rinse once. Transfer clothes to spin dryer. Use water for the entire 5 minutes. Turn off faucet. Drain the soapy water into a bucket then pour in the washer (if you have another load to wash). Spin for a second time with no water. Your clothes should be practically dry. Don't over load the washer as it will not spin effectively. The water level should cover the clothes completely. Also wash towels for last as the lint gets on clothes. Finally hang dry on the shower curtain rod and you're done. And you CAN wash and spin at the same time to speed up the entire wash day. Great buy!!<br /><br />Shipping was great. My washer arrived on time despite the delays with Hurricane Irma. I have already washed two &#34;loads&#34; one of which being my bathroom rug which took up the entire space in the washing tub. I decided to use my washer in the kitchen as opposed to the tub in the bathroom. It is not heavy but I imagined it can get tiresome moving it from the tub to the closet/wall. It is important to find an economical and functional space for it BEFORE you buy. As others have stated the paper directions that come with it are HILARIOUS so ignore those. A simple YouTube video on how it works is all you need. Another thing you will want to do is raise the washer off the ground. It is a gravity draining washer so you need to elevate it in order to drain completely. After looking for something to buy in store to no avail, I went to the hardware store and got materials to build this 9&#34; tall wooden stand. (tip: ask the associate to show you to the scrap wood area. You may get a deep discount and/or even free wood like I did). I used a large dish pan to catch the water. Don't worry. You'll only have to empty it to two times max. I thought about getting a small cooler on wheels that I can put down there to have the water drain into, then when full just roll it out to the backyard and water the grass...But for now this will do. The spinner is AMAZING! I set it on 5 minutes and my bathroom rug (which I squeezed down in there and set for only 3 mins.) was completely dry. Clothes are 85%-90% dry. My only gripe (thus the 4 star rating) is the water inlet tube is too short to reach my kitchen faucet so I'm in the process of looking for a longer one. I DO NOT want to have to move the washer directly in front of the kitchen sink!to wash. Overall I am satsistfied so far. I will try my best to update this post every 3 months.<br /><br />Recommendations:<br />1. If you notice leaks check your water level. Don't fill the water to high. I use the Medium line<br />2. Use just 1/4 cup of liquid soap or you will be rinsing for hours. And i do rinse at least one time. Drain the dirty water, fill tub with clean water and let wash for about 6 minutes. Less is truly more and your clothes will still be clean.<br />3. Use a fabric softener as well so your clothes won't have that rough, stiff feeling afterwards.<br />4. You will notice a burning rubber smell upon first use. Totally normally just like any electrical device when you first use it.<br />5. Don't overload the washer. It begins to shake when it's off balance. I washed 2 shirts, 3 pair of undies, one jean pant, 2 wash rags, 1 pair of socks sign I problem.<br />6. Leave both lids open after using so tubs can dry<br />7.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "True Companion to the College Experience", "text": "I'm a college student taking fifteen science credits and working part-time as a tutor. My days generally go from 8am to 8pm. My weekends have become homework/studying marathons. I often sit down at the start of each week and schedule my showers. Livin' the dream. So as a result, I hadn't done laundry in nearly three months. The clothes were piling up. So many clothes. So many. I've only had this guy for 48 hours, but he's changed my life. The clothes are clean and hanging in my closet where they belong. He's probably an angel. I have named him Wally.<br /><br />Things to consider (but not things major enough to detract from my appreciation for Wally):<br />- As other reviewers have noted, the inlet tube nozzle does not attach well to very many water sources. Buckets are your friends.<br />- This boy needs gravity to drain, so the draining tube has to rest at a point that's lower than or equal to where the unit is sitting. The tube is also quite short, measuring out to be just under two feet.<br />- You'd might as well throw out the instructions as soon as you open the box.<br /><br />It's super simple, but since the instructions are rubbish and, hey, new machines can be intimidating, here's how to use this boy:<br />1. Ensure the dial is set to &#34;soft&#34; or &#34;normal.&#34; There are only three options; as long as it's not on &#34;drain&#34;!<br />2. Slap yer detergent in!<br />3. Slap some clothes in--my best advice is to just use your best judgment. If it's a helpful reference, I just ran a load of four pairs of jeans, three T-shirts, and some miscellaneous socks and whatnot and still kicked myself for not throwing in a few more shirts.<br />4. Dump that water in, friend!<br />5. Set the timer to fifteen minutes. Or less, I won't tell you how to live your life.<br />6. Is he done? Good! Set the dial to &#34;drain&#34; and, leaving your clean and vaguely soapy clothing inside, refill the tub; this is going to be our makeshift rinse cycle. Set the timer to your desired quantity of minutes, wait patiently, and pat yourself on the back for getting your laundry done on time.<br />7. Is he done again? Even better! Now you have clean and not-soapy clothing. Excellent! Shove as much as you can sensibly fit into the spin chamber, ensuring the dial is still set to &#34;drain.&#34; You may need to separate the load, as his drying capacity isn't quite as great as his washing capacity. (I love him anyway.)<br />8. Close both spin lids--it's very important that the first one is closed all the way!--set the time, and let him rip! He will only spin for up to five minutes, but this is often more than enough.<br />9. He's done! Remove your things, hang them somewhere to dry, and thank him for a job well done.<br /><br />Disclaimer: There is a rubbery plate with holes in it that comes with the unit. You are probably supposed to use it. I have no idea where to put this or what it does, but Wally runs perfectly in spite its absence.<br /><br />Additional tips:<br />- Instead of fiddling with the inlet hose, good old-fashioned buckets are always an option! For me personally, the size of the unit and set-up of my apartment wouldn't allow me to attach it to a water source AND keep it within range a drain, so a 10-quart bucket has suited me fine. It's not as inconvenient as it sounds, promise!<br />- Kie, how much water goes in?! The instructions say to use 30-45 liters of water (depending on the size of the load), but I find that anything over about 38 liters (40 quarts) is too much once clothes are added.<br />- Kie, how much detergent do I use?! I find that filling my detergent cap to the lowest line (usually marked with &#34;1&#34; or similar) is suitable for medium- to heavy-sized loads.<br />- Kie, my boy keeps starting and stopping during the wash cycle! Is he okay? Yes! Starting and stopping every few seconds is normal; he's just changing directions and is still more than happy to clean your things.<br />- Kie, my boy is making scary sounds while he spins! Is he okay? Kind of! He's okay, but your things are very heavy and he may be asking you to take some out. He will also scream if things are sticking too far out of the chamber and getting close to the lid, so you may need to stop the spin cycle and gently readjust if this occurs. For me, this happened one time, and only because I was careless when loading things in--Wally is blameless.<br /><br />So in short, this guy is great. He may or may not require a little finagling in the set-up department, but if you are kind to him, he will wash your things with no complaints. He probably saved my life. He's perfect.", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AGZCFLFNTIEEKMAQ72HFOE6I36NQ", "timestamp": 1489363577000, "helpful_vote": 155, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Awesome powerful little portable washer for a great value!", "text": "I rarely write reviews but this product is just so wonderful that I feel I must!  I bought this to use on our boat about a year ago and it's been the best purchase.  It not only saves me time by not having to go home to do our laundry, or the hassel of going to the laundromat, but also money that I would have spent at the laundromat for &#34;not-so-clean&#34; clothes!  I have spent about the same amount of $ to purchase this washer as what I normally spend going to the laundromat in just 3 or 4 weeks time!  This machine is a workhorse, too.  I can wash 2-3 bath towels along with several sets of our clothes at the same time.  I've also washed a couple of extra large beach towels without any issue.  It cleans as good as my $2000 set that I use at home! Everything has a manual setting so I can choose how long things need to be washed and dried.  I love that it's also lightweight so I can easily slide it from the outside water source/sink over to the side of the boat to drain.  I can even reuse the water, if need be, with a bucket!  It uses a minimal amount of laundry soap and I can use my favorite bleach and fabric softeners.  I also love the &#34;dryer&#34;, which is basically just a spin cycle, but it works great!  Our clothes are just slightly damp after washing and spin drying and dry very fast on my clothes line.  I have told all of our dock neighbors and I'm now the envy of all who have witnessed the power of this little guy!  I've also recommended to family who spend winters in AZ in a park model home and also have a small living space like we do. They are loving this just as much as I do!

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great for RV/Travel trailer", "text": "We bought this for our travel trailer. We needed something for a small space, and didn\u2019t want to use up a half day at the laundry mat.<br /><br />Upon receiving, you can see from one of the photos a screw in the back was missing. We contacted the manufacturer who advised us to try and if the missing screw didn\u2019t affect the performance,  they\u2019d give us some of our money back. It did work and they upheld their end as stated.<br /><br />After using the first time our clothing was covered in lint. A quick google search led us to try 1/3 c white vinegar and 1/4 c baking soda added to each new water load. (That amount is for a full water load.) That breaks down and helps keep the majority of the lint from clinging to the fabric and works amazing! Of course that is added in addition to the typical detergent.<br /><br />Also the amount of lint that leaves the machine through the drain pipe is quite a bit. Being in a travel trailer we didn\u2019t want to put too much of that through the pipes. So, we tried a strainer in the drain which works amazing and catches all that extra lint.<br /><br />We use it in the shower, but as seen in one of the photos, something needs to be placed under the machines legs, as it will vibrate-although very little, it will scratch the shower/tub surface.<br /><br />The spinner simply spins out excess water. It does spin out a lot of water and some pieces of clothing will dry within a couple of hours; others take the normal amount of hanging to dry as it would coming from a normal full size washer in a typical residential home.

Sheets queen size takes about 4 hours to hang dry. I use a turkey baster to add water, as suggested on one of the reviews. Noise level I would not use at 4am because it is a little noisy but during the day not loud at all. Small socks can be a problem on the spinner and may land in the draining compartment.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "I LOVE THIS MACHINE! This thing really works!", "text": "First off let me start by saying I love my little washing machine. My husband who is 6\u20194\u201d and myself who is 6\u20192\u201d, are able to wash a good amount of clothes in this washer with spinner. We both wear 4X-6X tee shirts, shirts, blouses, and I wear 24-26 in jeans, shorts, dresses, and skirts and my husband wears (I think a 52 in bottoms). So our clothes are big, which made me hesitant to purchase this item. We both have different techniques for how we wash, rinse, and spin when we wash clothes, so find a technique that works for you. I waited a good while after purchasing this product to do a review because I wanted to give a true tried and trustworthy review the reflects months of usage. The only complaint I have about this product is how useless the connection hose is for it and being it was so useless we fill the machine up by hand with a storage bin and we empty it the same way. IT DOES NOT TAKE A LOT OF DETERGENT TO CLEAN YOUR CLOTHES! Let me repeat this again it doesn\u2019t take even a half of cap full of detergent to clean your clothes. We use Percil liquid detergent, OxyClean powder, Clorox bleach when needed, and quaternary disinfectant in each load.  We\u2019ve been using the same bottle of Percil and tub of OxyClean for about 6 months I think but anyways. It doesn\u2019t take much detergent and the reason for this is because the washer unit is very strong inside the washing tub. If you have lightly soil clothes it does not take a full 15 minutes to wash them. Put the timer on 3 or 6 minutes and you have fresh clean clothing. The longest I put my clothes to spin is 3-6 minutes max. Why? Because this baby doesn\u2019t need more time then that to spin the water out of garments. If items are heavily soil soak them first. Just fill the tub with dirty clothes and fill to water line or at least don\u2019t fill over filter line add detergent, turn timer to 3 minutes and then let the clothes soak for about 30 minutes to an hour. Do not soak clothes in chlorine bleach for over 10 minutes. If you do, you run the chance of destroying your clothes.  When I do a load of jeans I usually only put 2 pair max, 3 pairs of leggings, and maybe 3-4 pairs of workout shorts in a load and I turn the timer to 9 minutes with jeans. When it comes to shirts I can put at least 5-7 in one load; and for sheets I can do both flat and fitted but I do just one sheet at a time because they get cleaned better that way.<br /> After the first initial wash cycle completes I empty the tub. Then I refill it with clean water and do a short 3 minute cycle. Then I remove the clothes from the wash tub and put half in the spinner for 3 minutes. As the water is flowing from the hose to my storage bin I look to see how clean or dirty it is and that let\u2019s me know if and how much longer I need to rinse the clothes. So I take the first half of the load out the spinner and put them in the bath tub and run warm water over them and rinse them as the second half of the load spins. Take the first load out the tub and put back in the spinner and then hang them to dry. Yes, it seems a little much but I love to wash clothes by hand so it doesn\u2019t bother me. But if you can find a hose long enough to fit on the washing machine and a floor drain then you can eliminate a lot of the steps I go through on wash day. This baby is powerful and will rock if you have it placed off the floor. I took the styrofoam insert that came with it and tape cardboard around it and placed our washer on top of that. It was a very good set up until the cardboard got wet. I should have wrapped it in a trash bag after putting the cardboard on it, lol. Well hindsight is 50/50 and because it rocks I try not leave it while it is washing, because honestly who wants to clean up all that water? Not me!

It is small enough to fit in my patio storage closet so I converted the closet to a mini wash room. I can wash a small load in about 20-30 minutes and then spin dry them when i'm in a time crunch to dry everything. It can be tedious but I love the freedom of not having to go to a laundry facility or pay some company to hold my laundry money on a card that deducts $1.00 for every $5.00 I put on the card. If you are single this is perfect and I even when I move to a place with washer dryer hookups I think I will just rely on this. Not only is is a fraction of the cost of a typical washer and dryer system it suits my needs. As long as I remember to do my laundry 1-2 days before I need clean underwear, I am good. Yeah it does require you to put water in it for which I have been using a mop bucket and I take advantage of the slight foundation sagging in my storage closet open the door and let the hose run the water out onto the patio/ grass area. I just make sure to use eco friendly detergent to keep it from poisoning my green space.

The machine turned on when I plugged it in but it doesn't spin at all or wash the clothes at all.... The spin function in the washing machine side is completely pointless or at least broken on the machine that I received. I also tested the right side of the machine for the spin function and found that it too wasn't working. I literally did hours of research on how to use this machine and watched videos so I am sure that I was using the machine correctly (because the directions certainly didn't tell me how to use the machine and were full of grammatical errors and sentences that didn't make any sense and used completely wrong words).... This machine is a complete DUD and a waste of money. Not to mention, it says that it holds 11 pounds of clothing but that is a boldface lie- there is no way on Earth that this machine holds 11 pounds of clothing... I put about 3 pounds of clothing in it and it there was no way that it would have held anymore. Not sure how my return will go, but I will update this after the seller gets back to me.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great machine, needs some diy to make it work for you", "text": "I love this machine and use it to wash everything in my home. Six months in and it is still working perfectly. The only item I can\u2019t wash in it is the bed comforter as it is too large. We live in a five floor walk up and going up and down to the laundry room that works half the time has gotten too tedious over the years. This machine allows me the freedom to do laundry whenever I feel without exhausting myself.<br /><br />For a household of two, I keep things controlled with about 2 loads per week. I store the machine in our pantry, where I can easily slide it in and out. I used the top of a cheap turkey baster to attach the hose to the kitchen sink, as it wont connect on its own. As the machine drains from the bottom using only gravity, I lift it up using bed risers and drain the water into a five gallon bucket that I dump in the sink. I personally fill, run, and drain the wash cycle three times per load. This always cleans the clothes perfectly. The spin dryer wrings the clothes very well, but they still need to dry for at least 12 hours on a drying rack. Some lint is left on the clothes after each wash, but this is remedied with a lint roller. Our electric bill remains relatively low. I definitely feel I\u2019ve gotten my money\u2019s worth out of this machine and will never go back to a public laundromat.", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AHU65ZZBKJUTWIWGE3IFTM7MLTTQ", "timestamp": 1638563463907, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Came dirty, but works as intended. Good, bad, and a couple tips!", "text": "Good: It came in like 3 days! The box is not too heavy to get into your home on your own. It washes clothes fine and the spin dry works well. Your clothes will be dry and ready-to-wear the next day. I do not regret buying this thing (but will update this review if I have any problems).<br /><br />Bad: The washer side was dirty upon delivery. There were also a few water droplets! It smelled like fresh plastic but didn't look like it. I saw how difficult it was for other buyers to contact the seller so I just made sure it worked (it did) and cleaned it out with a gentle cleaner and paper towels, followed by filling it with water and a little vinegar and letting it run and drain. The machine is actually kind of hefty/awkward to move but not too bad. A little bigger than expected.<br /><br />Advice: (1) You do NOT need to attach the 'water inlet' hose to this thing. I just use a bucket of water and pour it into the machine. Probably faster this way anyway.<br /><br />(2) If you're like me and have a small/tiny bathroom and nothing to put this thing on, you can get away with draining MOST of the water into a bucket on the ground next to the machine (no machine elevation needed). Once most of the water is out, it will be light enough to manually raise up onto the side of the tub to finish draining... a little extra but it works if you don't have anything to put this thing on.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Such a clever little machine!!!", "text": "I absolutely adore this nifty little guy! It was the perfect solution for living in a small space and wanting to avoid using a small community laundromat because people tend to hog the machines. Definitely not for the absent-minded; just be smart about not overloading it, have enough water to cover the clothes, do NOT use too much detergent, and if you don't have a place to drain the water and plan to use a 5 gallon bucket like I do--just be mindful. A \"full\" wash load generally doesn't need more than 5 minutes in my opinion. I was surprised at how powerful this machine is, it's impressive! Not a machine you can walk away from, at least not for me. I usually have to hold onto it to keep it steady for a full load, probably an unnecessary precaution on my part, but that's how strong it is. I do have it on a raised surface to drain. Other reviews say that's not necessary, you'll have to find that out for yourself. The spinner part is awesome too, doesn't usually need any more than 2 minutes. Clothes come out slightly damp so underwear/t-shirts air dry in about an hour, which is pretty quick compared to air drying clothes coming out of a regular washer.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "I'd buy this again in a heartbeat!", "text": "I have this portable washing machine! My husband and I live on the third floor, so getting the laundry done is a Pain.<br /><br />We have it on wooden board on the back of the tub - the wooden board has non-slip grips on it, and we weigh it down with some 5 pound hand weights to help with the vibrations. If there was somewhere I could place it on the ground that I could still drain it from I'd do that, but this works pretty well.<br /><br />Tips, tricks, and other important things from someone who's had this for a year plus:<br /><br />1) You NEED a mesh lint trap and some cut pantyhose over that, attached to the drain hose. A lot of lint comes out of the machine.<br /><br />2) You also NEED those floating lint catch things for agitater-less washing machines. The built in one catches next to nothing. (You still need the mesh and pantyhose combination too.)<br /><br />3) You can wash the equivalent of 8 L/XL men's shirts at a time. Personally, I do one 15 minute round with hot soapy water, then one or two 15 minute rounds of cool plain water. You can salad-spin dry 4 L/XL men's shirts at a time.<br /><br />(You can't have the washer washing and the spinner spinning at a time, FYI. As I'm filling the tub is when I'm spinning the clothes.)<br /><br />4) Soap. A tablespoon or so of laundry detergent is good, or one detergent pod broken down into two cups of hot water. That's the perfect amount for us.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good price for a portable washing machine. Is it as good as a proper washing machine and heated dryer? No. Does it work for smaller spaces, as long as you don't mind the washing and drying times?

But if you're not in a hurry and have all day to spare, it's a convenient way to get your laundry done. Washer is only good for one wash so you will have to refill the washer again for a second wash but it can be rinsed in dryer with water to get the clothes cleaner especially if you have a lot of clothes in it at a time. Info: dryer/riser is only about 5 or 6 minutes long which it comes out pretty rinsed out and it doesn't take very long for it to air dry. Dryer time is only a 15 minute wash which when I do a second wash, it just takes too much time. Personally, I feel the clothes don't feel or look clean enough until it has been completely rinsed while in the dryer. Note: If you don't want your mini washer/dryer to brake down, do not exceed the recommended loading wash into the the washer/dryer. I have tried it once and it started to smell like burn rubber. Also everything you need will come with the washer. \ud835\udc0e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc32 \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20 \ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc31\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1a \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc32\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2e \ud835\udc30\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc25 \ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc28 \ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc32 \ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc1a \ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc27'\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc30\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21. \ud835\udc08\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27 \ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc1a \ud835\udc25\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc25 $ \ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e.", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AHUQKWA44LFPHEBD7NHD3S4H3EQQ", "timestamp": 1520213451476, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

The speed the spinner moves at really takes a lot of the water out and leaves clothes ready to hang, or for tumble drying. Total time: 15 mins. I highly recommend this washer to anyone looking for a personal/small home alternative to apt or public laundromats!", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AE2XWA4RBXMTVV4GEPE3CMY36U6A", "timestamp": 1612884264306, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Almost speechless. PERFECT for a primary OR secondary washing machine, dorm rooms and cloth diapering.", "text": "I am SUPER greedy with my 5 star reviews but I'd give this one a 10 star if I could. I bought this to use while my full size washer was being repaired. It came in and I ALMOST returned it because my full sized was fixed. THEN there was an issue with the drain pipe from my full sized washer. SO, I opened this one. I was reallyyyy skeptical because its so light and small..I mean, my first thoughts were, &#34;Can this REALLY possibly wash clothes and get them CLEAN?!&#34; Uhh YES.<br /><br />Setting up:<br />I have a second bathroom so I just placed the whole set up by the tub. (This can EASILY be set in and out of the tub if you wanted to do it that way) The plug in cord, water line and drain hose are all relatively short. The diameter of the water line is about nickle sized, the drain hose is about golf ball sized. (my awful measurement descriptions, sorry, lol) Its pretty cut and dry. Don't expect that water line to fit pretty much any standard faucet or water outlet. Be prepared to manually fill it with a bucket until you figure out what to connect the line to. I actually went to a hardware store and got a rubber hose and tension clamp.<br /><br />First use:<br />I plug it in and put 4 full sized towels, 3 tshirts and a handful of socks in, a teeny amt of laundry soap and washed for 12 minutes. The guide says to wash fora bout 6 minutes. I went longer because i thought it wasn't going to work for just 6. Wrong again, for that load, i could have easily went for 6 minutes...10 minutes if I wanted to drag it out. To drain the water, you turn the dial from Normal to Drain. Its a gravity drain but works well. After draining the water, I rinsed them and eyeballed the spin dryer.<br /><br />Rinsing:<br />There are really two ways to do this. (1) is to hook the water line to the right side of the machine and as it spins, turn the water on for about 5 seconds and then turn it off and let it spin another 15 seconds. (2) is to drain the wash, add clean water and let it run another 3 minutes then drain and spin. (IF you want to use fabric softener: drain, fill, add softener, 3min cycle, drain and rinse)<br /><br />The spin dryer:<br /> I dropped a towel in (soaking wet) closed the lid and turned the dial. WHOA. 15 seconds of spin and i cut it off. Opened it up and pulled a &#34;damp&#34; towel out. By damp, I mean, if you shower, get out and dry your hair and body off with a towel kind of damp. I was super impressed.  When you spin dry, only put in 3-4 things and make sure to drop them straight into the middle so it can balance it as it starts to spin.It only takes 15-20 seconds to spin the hell out of anything you put in there. Why this timer goes up so high is beyond me. You should NEVER need to spin anything that long in this machine...unless you're using it to churn a gallon of butter.<br />ONE LOAD: 1 min to fill, 6 min to wash, 3 min to rinse with spinner (4-5 to rinse with washer tub) TEN- TWELVE minutes for ONE load of laundry. You can NOT beat that.<br /><br />Overall:<br />I am shocked. Highly impressed and I am SO glad I kept this. I have 3 daughters (ages 10-15) who LOVE changing clothes 11 times a day. This is now THEIR washing machine. 9pm and you realize you don't have your favorite skirt clean? Go wash it in YOUR machine. For my teenager, one load will hold 3 pair of uniform pants, three tops, 2 skirts, a tshirt or two and underclothes. This could be a serious game changer for dorm rooms, extended vacations and guest houses. I can't tell you how underestimated this thing is. This machine makes it ok to just wash a shirt and a pair of pants. You control the amount of water, time and soap so you aren't wasting anything. If you're on the fence about it, rest assured that this little sucker will surprise you.<br /><br />As a side note, those who use cloth diapers, reusable menstrual underwear or cloth feminine products, this is the PERFECT laundry machine. Its almost like it was made for it. We cloth diaper and I can easily soak, wash and strip a days worth of diapers in no time. AND it spins out the water so well that it takes MINIMAL drying time.", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AHY5BP53PV6EY5RXWZ2WPL44YK5A", "timestamp": 1472059696000, "helpful_vote": 46, "verified_purchase": true}

I moved into a house and bought a brand new GE front load washing machine that has been nothing but headache and a big waste of hard earned money if I could I would shoot it with a cannon lol anyways I bought another one of these small machines since I gave my old one to a friend that still uses it till this day. Now I\u2019m enjoying my old routine having a few beers while doing laundry and it gets my clothes a lot cleaner than any he machine since it actually fills with water and thrash\u2019s my clothes in vortex of water and detergent and a serious spin that extracts  instead of being  slopped around in a shallow puddle of H.E BS that takes over a hour to barley do anything that reflects a good wash. Yea it\u2019s not a fully automatic machine BUT IT DOES ITS JOB AND DOES IT WELL and that makes it worth the extra effort any day of the week. If you live in a apartment with no washing machines I would highly recommend. If you have a nice big house and are in the market for big new machines SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY ON COMMERCIAL SPEED QUEEN MACHINES THAT ARE BUILT TO LAST A LIFETIME AND WILL CLEAN BETTER THAN ANY H.E MACHINE AT BEST BUY.", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AE4NJO5L4ZXFKPWLVXOSIAPQHGBA", "timestamp": 1676196178353, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

The customer service department is wonderful! I do laundry 3 days a week and this works nicely.<br /><br />I hooked this up in my basement to the utility tub and put the drain tube in the drain hole. I used my old washing machine hoses to connect to the unit and sink just cutting the hose to size with a kitchen knife so no real issues there.<br /><br />The unit itself is deceivingly small upon appearance but I can fit a whole bunch of clothes in there. As long as I divide them up in the spinner, I can fit in one load:<br /><br />10 T-Shirts- Ranging from size 5/6 (kids) to Adult XL<br />3 hoodies- Sizes Small-Xl<br />10 pairs of yoga pants/kids sized pants<br />3 pairs of jeans/sweatpants Adult sizes<br />A massive amount of socks/underwear/bras<br />4 full sized towels.<br />3 queen sized sheets<br />4 single sheets<br />smaller blankets/NO QUILTS<br /><br />For drying, I bought garment racks for $10 each and put them over heater vents in my apartment. I just hang up the clothes, and they dry in a few hours. Towels I line dry in my basement, and for socks/underwear bras etc I use a laundry bag and place it on the heater vent and shake it up whenever I remember. I do plan on buying a dryer eventually but for now this works for my family of 6.<br /><br />The cons are you do have to fill, drain and spin. It is not automatic, so if you are the type that needs/wants a machine that does it all for you this is not it. On the other hand, if you are happy just having clean clothes, and don't mind a little extra work, it is well worth the price.", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AGTNQ4BFSJCCUJMBIXSSG45XTBTA", "timestamp": 1485540116000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

It doesn't come a with a hose for the fill spouts. Honestly not a big deal I just use my showerhead to fill the machine. However if you want the hose you got to buy it separately.<br />2. It's noisy.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "No more nasty laundromats! Yay!", "text": "I purchased one of these little washers for my daughter and son-in-law who live in their 5th wheel. Their RV is plumbed for a combo washer/dryer, but they don't have an extra $1200 laying around right now to purchase one.They recently had a baby and are cloth diapering, and trying to find laundromats on the road can be problematic when needing to do laundry very frequently, not to mention the cost. They've had the Giantex mini for a month and love it!  I also live in my RV and travel full time and just purchased a second unit for myself.<br />Yes, it's made in China, something I try to avoid. Yes, it's all plastic, again something I try to avoid. Yes, if you wash a large load you will have to spin it in two separate loads. No, the hose doesn't fit on any faucet known to modern man, but in an RV they work fantastically just placing the washer in the tub or shower, using the handheld shower head to fill it. No, it doesn't have a drain pump and relies on gravity but again it works fine in an RV just laying the drain hose in the bottom of the shower so the waste water goes right down the drain.  Weight is always a major consideration in an RV, and at only 25 pounds or so it's lightweight enough to easily move it when you need the tub/shower.<br /> This little machine is amazing. It holds a surprisingly large amount of clothes. A typical load for me consists of a pair of jeans, a t-shirt, a tank top, a  pair of underwear, a  pair of socks, maybe a dish towel or sweatshirt. The jeans do twist up a bit, but nothing major. Everything comes out clean, and the lint trap in the washer seems to work pretty well.  The loads only take a teaspoon or two of laundry soap, another cost saving.<br />The spin dryer works extremely well, removing an amazing amount of moisture, and items hung indoors dry within a hour or so, jeans or heavy sweatshirts of course taking a bit longer. If I hang things outside they dry even faster. The machine is also very quiet both washing and spinning. The spinner is a little loud when it first starts, but once it gets up to speed and has jettisoned most of the water it's very quiet.<br /> I can wash any of my clothing, towels or queen size sheets with no problem. Obviously a spin dryer won't remove lint as well as a conventional dryer does so I wash bath towels separately.  If I washed delicates I would probably put them in a mesh bag to protect them. The only thing I will still have to take to the laudromat occasionally is a thick comforter due to it's size.<br />For the purchase price of $85, this is the bomb. If it only lasts 3 or 4 months it will have more than paid for itself, and I would just order a new one instead of going back to hauling things to the laudromat.", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AF6WOHRXHK5UUNOUJWF4Y4R274HQ", "timestamp": 1465932224000, "helpful_vote": 36, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Good buy. Works well.", "text": "Works great, wish it auto drained after a cycle though! Can't tell you how many times I've started and forgotten it! I might think about modifying it if anything breaks. If it lasts two more years I'll give a 5 star rating!<br />Tip: Don't wash towels with anything else. Lint gets everywhere!<br />Tip: Use Fabric softener!!! Didn't use any the first time and my clothes where like cardboard.<br />Tip: Buy a cheap clothes rack. The spin cycle will by no means dry your clothes. They will still be damp. Hang em up!<br />Tip: Sometimes there's dirt left in the wash bin after a cycle, so rinse it out before doing another load.<br />Tip: Others usually run a rinse cycle as well as the wash cycle, I just run a wash cycle and my clothes come out okay. User-preference.<br /><br />Overall it was fairly cheap and saved me from going to the terrible laundromat or driving an hour to my dad's. As long as you do a load as it comes you'll never have to do a ton of loads at once. It's also a plus since utilities are paid in my apartment so this is a huge cost saver.<br /><br />When you get it, rinse it out. They test them in what appears to be a dirt covered area. The feet where dirty and there was a little dirt inside.<br /><br />My setup:<br />I have this setup next to my shower, which I put on one of those shower heads with the detachable head and I use that to fill it. I run the drain pipe into the shower. I use the water tube it came with as a bumper to reduce the vibrations by connecting each end to both inlets and then letting it hang behind it. I then scoot it against the wall.<br /><br />Instructions (since the ones with it are in broken English.<br />Wash:<br />Before running a wash cycle make sure the center knob isn't on drain.<br />1. Load laundry, not too much.<br />2. Fill to just under the top two holes by the lint catcher.<br />3. Push your clothes down and if you can fit a few more add them now.<br />4. Add about a half cup of detergent, and about a quarter cup of softener.<br />5. Turn the Wash timer knob to the full 15 minutes.<br />6. When it's done turn the center knob to drain.<br />After it has drained move your clothes to the spin drum.<br />'Drying':<br />Before 'Drying' make sure the center knob is on drain.<br />1. Add clothes, no more than the inner ring of the spin drum.<br />2. Put the little round plastic piece on top of your clothes and push them down as much as you can keeping it level.<br />3. Close the lid and turn the 'De-watering' knob to the full five minutes.<br />It'll start to vibrate and sound like its coming apart but it will soon stabilize and the noise will go down a bit.<br />Once done hang them.<br /><br />It is fairly loud if you are by it, but I close the door to my shower (its in its own little room here, weird right?) and I can't really here it much.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "It works well.", "text": "I am a graduate student living in an apartment with no private washer/drier. This is the only thing that I use to wash my clothes. It works well. The only thing that I don't like is the hose lengths/ diameters. That being said with a little bit of ingenuity it is easy to figure out. Also, the instructions do not make sense but it is self explanatory. Here are the steps that I take (others might do it differently).<br /><br />1)Move washer into the bathtub, connect the hose to a water supply somehow (I use the showerhead and a glove), and insert the other side of the hose into the washer input (there is a washer and a spin cycle input, the washer one is the leftmost one). Connect to the power supply.<br />2) Fill with clothes but be careful not to overfill. If you overfill you will notice that once you start the engine will struggle quite a bit. If this happens just take some of the clothes out.<br />3) Start to fill up with warm water and add washing detergent. Use a lot less detergent than you normally would.<br />4) Wash for 13 min. Once the cycle is over drain (if you have more clothes that you need to wash I take the clean clothes out and add the dirty clothes in with the same water). Drain once done.<br />5)Move some of the clothes to the spinner. Make sure that it is balanced and not overfilled (I do it about halfway). Add the security lid.<br />6) Connect hose to the rinse input on the left side and start rinsing the clothes in the spinner with cold water. Spin for 30 secs and rinse again. After you are happy with the rinse spin for 2 and a half minutes.<br />7)Repeat as necessary (about two spin cycles per washing load) and airdry all your clothes once you are finished.", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AHG5K22Y2ZMWBKKO4NK7QGHWXL4A", "timestamp": 1605479565399, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

That wouldn\u2019t be the biggest deal in the world, but then I saw that one of the bolts that holds the washer motor secure was straight up missing. Not in the box, and nowhere to be found. Due to it not being there, the motor rocks like crazy and has been slowly leaning towards the washer. It has also been making an awful burning smell due to the belt burning (I can only assume due to the leaning motor caused by the missing pieces).<br /><br />I\u2019d go out and get some replacement pieces for the motor, but in order to install them I\u2019d have to take apart the entire inside and then reassemble it.

I purchased this item 6 months ago, I've had absolutely no problem with my washer, If you have the money I'd look into a portable dryer with a heating element. After a bit my clothes would be stiff yet once I'd put the clothes away or hang them they'd be just fine.<br />I love how little detergent it needs to actually clean clothes. Super economical and awesome!<br /><br />I'm going to be super honest, the 1 reason why It took me almost 3 months of investigation before I bought a portable washer is because I'm big, like a big gal (270). And I also have a big man(250), so I needed something that could handle our big clothes. This was an absolute fit, I can do 4 shirts, 2 pants and a handful of undies in 1 load. It's super helpful, I also bought a clothes rack from Wal-Mart for $16 and hung the clothes for a good 5 hours and Presto!", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71CwoULJ3qL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71CwoULJ3qL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71CwoULJ3qL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AEBIWVSQDEWOGEYRPDOHROG2TFPQ", "timestamp": 1497134791730, "helpful_vote": 27, "verified_purchase": true}

Within a few hours most everything is dry. I am now able to clean my 6 year old uniforms and jerseys more often without running to the laundromat! I do agree with others as the hose is small and doesn't fit any sink but I did see a picture of another user using a Turkey baster so I tried that my own way and that works great! I still have 5 stars bc the hose problem didn't bother me that much. The machine is not heavy and I am able to move it when I am not using it since I use it in my bathroom.

Is it worth the money? Is it going to break down after 3 months then I\u2019m screwed? I am here to tell you that after 3 years of having my washer, ITS STILL RUNNING LIKE A PRO!<br /><br />Pointers I would recommend: If the hoses don\u2019t directly fit, then just put your shower head (hose) into the tub directly and fill it that way. And as long as you can get the washer high enough so that the drain tube can make it over the side of the tub to drain into the tub, then you\u2019re good to go!<br /><br />I ended up buying a flat dolly (kind of like a little pallet on wheels) from a hardware store then added some small planks of wood on top of that to raise it even higher then put the washer on top. It works like a charm!<br /><br />I would recommend the following in this order:<br /><br />- Wash a load for like 10 mins; drain the water and begin refilling with clean water<br /><br />- Put that load in the spinner for the full 5 minutes (the dial maxes out at 5 mins)<br /><br />- Once the tub is refilled, take the load out of the spinner and into the tub to rinse. Give it a solid 8 minutes.<br /><br />-Finally put in the spinner for 5 minutes and they are good to dry!<br /><br />I hope you found this helpful because let\u2019s face it: this is all new to you. You don\u2019t want to waste your time on crap product and you also have no clue how the hell it works in the real world. I hope I answered all those questions for you.<br /><br />Make the purchase.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Very good as long as you know it's limitations", "text": "[[VIDEOID:8089a25eb7c0eb1b9eb048eb45484d]] I bought this washer after Hurricane Harvey destroyed my home in 2017.  I made this video after a few months use and still to this day in October 2021, use it.  In fact, since my Whirlpool broke and I was waiting for replacement parts, I used it the other day to wash 3 loads so I, and my sons could have clean clothes.<br /><br />First thing you should know is to NOT overload it.  2-3 pairs of jeans MAX.  You can wash a light twin/full fleece blanket but only 1 at a time.  Normally you would put in enough clothes to fill it no more than 2/3rd full, half full would be better.  As for water, do not fill it higher than the top of the filter in the back corner.  The 2 water inlets have a diameter of 1/2 inch, so I use clear vinyl tubing on them.  DO NOT use a hose clamp to tighten on any hose, the plastic can crack.<br /><br />In my video, you'll notice I wash, drain, spin, rinse, spin.  I do it this way because I have allergies and I need to get as much soap out as I can.  As for soap, use very little.  Liquid soap I use a 20 oz bottle capful, powdered soap I use 2 capfuls.  Any more than that and you will be rewashing your clothes 2-3 times to get all the soap out.<br /><br />When using the spinner, be sure to use the included flexible cover and push down firmly on the clothes to force out as much water before closing the lid and running the spin cycle.  That will lessen the possibility of out of balance vibration which could damage the motor and it's bearings.<br /><br />I have rinsed clothes while they were being spun, however that doesn't seem to get all the detergent out and as I said, I have allergies and need it all out.  So I rinse my clothes through a second wash cycle with fresh water.<br /><br />The plastic top of mine has yellowed, but that doesn't affect the washer at all, and when I washed clothes the other day out on the porch since the weather was nice and I could reuse the water to water my garden, I just sat on the porch and read while the clothes washed.  The sun light seemed to have faded the yellowing plastic back towards white.<br /><br />All in all, this was a good purchase for my family.  Just as long as you are aware of it's limitations, you should have no issues.", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AG3BOQXQFR4GTVKBENR7D5TDAI3A", "timestamp": 1634426442305, "helpful_vote": 101, "verified_purchase": true}

I bought it not really expecting much but I still can't believe how great it works. I live in an apt where having a washer and dryer isnt an option. I can use the ones in the basement but they suck and cost more then the laundromat. But I hate the laundromat even more.  I was hoping to be able to do a few shirts and a pair of jeans during the week just to get by til I had to no choice but go do laundry. I haven't had to go since I got this washer. I can do Jean's, heavy sweaters, and sweat shirts. You just have to take it easy when loading it. I can do two pairs of Jean's and a few shirts with no problem. Just keep in mind this isnt a full size and is somewhat small. But if you dont over load it your clothes will come out very clean.  I get filthy at work. My work clothes are usally covered in grease and dirt. Most of which are heavily stained.  I've had a few pairs of jeans and shirts that look brand new after I washed them.  And the spinner rings out the clothes so good they come out almost dry. I just wish the spinner was bigger.  I have to split up a load but its not worth complaining about. I decided to just get a cheap drying rack to dry everything and with in a few hours everything is usally dry because of how well this thing rings out your clothes. Even if it broke today I would buy another one with out hesitation. It's already paid for itself by not having to go to the laundromat but not having to deal with the creepy weirdos or listen to a couple with 10 kids that run around like animals as they yell at them in some foreign language is priceless. The last time I went to the laundromat one of these disgusting animals threw one of their kid's dirty diapers in a washing machine full of crap which is what caused me to take a chance and purchase this.

I have 2 small children so laundry builds up fast. I am not a fan of laundromats and there is no washer and dryer connection in my apartment. This machine is small, but gets the clothes cleaner than any washer I have ever used. Yes, the hose doesn't fit on any faucet in my apartment.. Lol. But is an easy fix with a quick trip to your local hardware store. I seen someones review on here where they used a turkey baster as a water hose adapter.... That works as well.. Lol. It is well worth the money.. I received the machine clean and in perfect shape. I've done well over 10 loads in one day, with no issues. Only a little soap is needed... and for draining convenience, I suggest you put the machine in the bathtub, if possible.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Strong little machine! Edit: One year later", "text": "Edit 2: I tried to get a replacement part but no one responded to my calls or emails. Luckily I bought a warranty but I just got a gift certificate. I won\u2019t be buying another one. The laundromat costs the same as the large water bill I got by using this machine.<br /><br />Edit: The machine still works, but the spinner has provided many problems. Sometimes it\u2019d take forever to get to a high speed. My fianc\u00e9 would have to take off the back and tighten a loose bolt. Recently the rim of the spin became horribly torn up. I had to take it off. It still spins but it can\u2019t be filled fully or else the clothes fly out. I posted a pic of the spinner without the cover<br /><br />This is a pretty good machine! I had a towel stained with old tomato sauce and it got rid of majority of them without stain remover. I give it 4 stars because it took some rigging to do. Like everyone else, the water hose didn't fit my faucet. I wanted to keep the drain hose by my tub so I got a funnel to put in the water hose so I could hold it up to my shower. The power cord isn't that long either (maybe 4ft). The instruction manual was missing the installation page and was worded weirdly. I had to look it up online. Otherwise I have no issues! The rest of this review is just FYI stuff.<br /><br />One thing I didn't know about this before I bought it was that you need to switch the clothes from the washing tub to the spin tub and back. A wash will take about 10min then you need to put it to spin for 2min, put it back in the wash tub to rinse after changing the water, put it back to spin, and so forth. It's not hard work but you can't just put the laundry in and go watch TV. (EDIT: I found a tip online that said to rinse right after the wash so you only have to spin once)<br /><br />I bought this thinking the spin tub was a dryer for some reason, but that's my fault. It actually dries really well though. I was in doubt about how something so small can dry so fast but it does. It can't fit many towels but when it comes to shirts there's plenty room. The spinner is smaller than the wash tub.

We hang dry our clothes on a line with a fan in the room and they are dry in an hour or two after the spin dry cycle!

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Giantex waste of money", "text": "So my wife had me buy this compact twin washer/spin dryer so she could wash clothes here at home. The stupid thing doesn't fit our hook ups nor will it even attach to the sink. The drain is gravity only, so it's a ton of effort if you even want to use the crap machine because you have to haul it, while full of water, away from the kitchen or bathroom outside to drain, and you have to do that every single time you put a new load in, and being a compact, it doesn't hold very large loads, so to do what would normally be a full load of laundry, you would have to go back and forth at least three times. I emailed the company asking if I could send the thing back because we don't have any way to hook up the water to it. They say I can, but because it isn't a quality issue, I'd have to pay the shipping, which costs 50% more than I paid for the darn thing, so sending the thing back wasn't an option. On top of that, my wife is determined to keep the stupid thing and insists it's worth it to try to use it and will not let me even think about getting on LSN or Craigslist to just get a full size washer and dryer. So, I guess I'm stuck with this useless piece of garbage that I can't return and I can't replace because my wife is too in love with it to see that it isn't worth the hassle all because it was cheap, but I can't throw it away or give it away because then I would be throwing away money. I'm so frustrated with this piece of crap that I just want to beat the thing to hell with a sledgehammer, pour gasoline on it and set it on fire, then take the remains and toss them off a cliff into the ocean.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Game changer for a small apartment in quarantine", "text": "My husband and I bought this washer for our apartment to avoid having to go to our building's shared laundry space during corona quarantine. LOVE IT. It agitates the clothes surprisingly well and spins them mostly dry. We were really pleased by the results. How we use it:<br /><br />1) We fill it via bucket, as some others on here do. The water intake hose it comes with is garbage and we didn't want to go to the hardware store to rig up something new. Bucket method works fine! We fill the left washer bin about 2/3 at MOST then add 1/4 cup of soap (or less) and then clothes. Do NOT overfill this machine! Aim to have clothes and water level off around the middle of the filter piece at max.<br /><br />2) Since the directions it comes with are useless...One washing cycle looks like this for us: 15 mins in left tub at normal agitation with the soap; then remove in batches into right tub to spin out for maybe 1-2 mins (as needed, right tub is smaller than left); Spun clothes go back into the left side and are rinsed/agitated with water again for 15 mins; Spin out again for 2-3 min. Hang up clothes to dry.<br /><br />3) It is lightweight enough that we store it away when we don't need it and lift it into our standard bathroom tub for use. The drain tube works well this way and it makes filling it easier. Each of us can lift it into the tub pretty easily.<br /><br />Even though we love this washer and are very happy with the purchase, here are a few caveats we noticed that you may want to consider before buying.<br /><br />A) Other reviewers have said it and it's true...this is NOT a hands off washing process like a regular washer. You do need to go back and forth to the machine to fill/spin during the cycle. BUT that said, going from your couch to bathroom to fill a bucket is an improvement over running to the basement to switch out laundry loads.<br /><br />B) The capacity is about half of a regular load of laundry. So this means that for every \"regular machine\" load of laundry...this machine will require two full cycles. In order to not over-stress the machine's motor, we usually limit our full cycles to 3 in a day. And then do laundry a couple times a week. (Again we're in quarantine, so this is big entertainment!) We have successfully washed our queen sheet sets over two loads...came out great. We wash our waffle weave towels (another life game changer for a different review), sweats, hoodies, PJs, undies, and other items with no problems. I cannot speak to how this machine would handle traditional terry cloth towels or jeans. I'd say do just a couple at a time, as those items would be heavy when wet.<br /><br />C) Because you will line dry all of your items after washing and spinning, items will of course be a little \"crunchy\" instead of having that nice commercial dryer fluffiness. Is this an adjustment for regular laundry? Yes. However, if you use this machine for sheets, polyester-based clothes, or blended fabrics like sweats or exercise gear, the items honestly come out pretty normal. It's the 100% cotton items like dish towels or some underwear that get crunchy. If it bugs you a lot, I have found that steam ironing specific items will make them feel softer and obviously get rid of those washer wrinkles.<br /><br />Overall I am very happy with this machine, esp. for the price. It has saved us a lot of anxiety and added convenience.", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AEWI2WH7FTKAQUXLONWN3XPOZ27Q", "timestamp": 1587057394836, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

Many  reviews especially videos did help me to find the right washing machine. Finally I decided to order this one.  It delivered to my place next day!  I was worried about connecting with the faucet.  I read many reviews about using a bucket to fill in water.  I did and it works perfectly.  I don't need to run to a hardware store to purchase the connectors.  I didn't even read the instructions.  After I unpacked it, I set up in the bathroom and place the hose on the floor near shower drain.  Then i used a bucket to pour water and detergent (don't pour too much) in the machine. And I'm ready to go!  I am so grateful to own this washing machine.  The motor of washing is quite powerful.  The drying is good too even it didn't dry the clothes completely.  It did save me lots of time and money.  I can wash my clothes any time without worrying contacting with others.  I just wish the company can improve the capacity so I can wash more clothes at once but I still love this washing machine.  No complaints.  I think the next thing I'm going to purchase is a drying machine :). One advice for washing:. Do not put too much clothes at one time.  If you see the washing motor is slowing down that means you probably put too much clothes.  I tried to be careful not to put too many clothes and break the machine.  The machine needs cares too!!<br />Updated: After 7 months, the dryer stop working properly. OMG!

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Excellent Portable and Spin dryer. Looove it!", "text": "I loooooove this machine!<br />I couldn\u2019t  wait to try it out. And it works very well! Excellent washer and spin dryer!<br />I love to do laundry but hated going to laundry mat. I have a LG combo machine but ever since we move  to this house on the  2nd floor we are not allowed to use our wonderful LG machine. So we have been sending our clothes to be washed because I have no time to go to the laundry mat for hours. So I\u2019m very happy to have found this gem by Costway - washer and spin dryer.<br />The washer holds a lot of clothes. I have two boys and a 6 feet 2 inches husband and I can wash their clothes in this machine. No wringing required after washing you can transfer to the spin side and begin to wrince and spin dry. I\u2019m so excited about that part of the machine. No more hand washing and having to wring out pieces. All done in this wonderful machine! If I could tak a picture of me kissing this machine I would but that TMI lol.<br />The only reasons I didn\u2019t give it 5 stars is the hose. The hose is way too shore and fragile. I used the set up of one of the other reviews. On two chairs (until I can a stand with wheels) in my bathroom and attached the hose to my shower and the drain hose in the bathtub. You can not turn on the water and leave this machine it does not shut off your pipe automatically. Remember to keep middle knob on normal or soft. Not drain or the water your using to wash will drain out. So you must keep an eye on it. Which is still better than going to the laundromat. There is no Assembly needed. Just connect the hose to water, have some where to drain water out and plug in and let the magic begin. You will start to love doing laundry again. I would give it 4 1/2 stars but I only can give 4 or 5 stars. Anyway well worth the price and highly recommended. Don\u2019t wait to get one. You won\u2019t regret it.

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Get Something Else", "text": "This is the first time writing an Amazon review but I feel like I have to.<br /><br />I researched FOREVER to find a good washer/dryer for a decent price. I read the reviews and saw the worst of the worst, and also the best. I finally came around and bought this one.<br /><br />For the first few days this thing was god-sent. Washed and dried beautifully, and the dryer got the clothes SUPER dry, like, unbelievably dry.<br /><br />However, its only been a few days. I thought I heard strange noise coming from the washer as it ran, thinking it was jean buttons racing against the inside and ignored it until it happened the following day with a few shirts and socks. I knew there were reviews about sparking, but I thought that was a one in a million chance and cant possibly happen with my machine.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />Inside the washer right under the dials there were blue sparks that lit up when the agitator stopped. After seeing the sparks, the strange noise sounded like electric currents, so I turned off the machine instantly and unplugged it.<br /><br />I contacted the seller and they are giving me a full refund and have advised me to STOP USING THE MACHINE IF IT SPARKS. They said i can either toss it or find a repair man to fix it, so I tried finding someone to check it out to see if it can be salvaged or fixed.<br /><br />Nope. Not a single person in NYC services these lil washers. And if they did, they told me the parts and repair would cost more than what it\u2019s worth. No idea why it sparked but water and open NOISY electric currents do not mix.<br /><br />I kept it unplugged and figured I should just dry the clothes in there regardless (might as well since that still works). I was wrong again.<br /><br />The entire time both worked beautifully but in a matter of DAYS the dryer stops spinning and the washer is trying to kill me.<br /><br />At least they're giving me a full refund. Now I just have to figure out how I\u2019m dumping this and finding a different company washer/dryer.<br /><br />Also for those whose machines are sparking and keep using it, DONT. If the company itself is refunding me without hesitation, you probably shouldn\u2019t keep using it.<br /><br />Totally sucks because this thing was awesome :/", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AHGCBEABPWLN5GELV27VMGIYDPPQ", "timestamp": 1660780642461, "helpful_vote": 14, "verified_purchase": true}

When we unboxed it today though we found many dents, scratches, and dirt on the machine that would imply normal use wear and tear. There are scratches around the knobs, a big dent in the front, the feet were all dirty straight out of the box, and the outlet hose had a weird stain. That being said this is an amazing little washer. It agitates arguably better than some full size household washers. The spin dryer is great too it gets the clothes about 99% dry. I can wash a load in about 20 minutes as well so that is also a big plus. If you buy this I would recommend watching a how to video  on YouTube because the instruction booklet was no help at all.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "GREAT FOR AN APARTMENT", "text": "Alright - I recently rented an apartment and bought this one because it was the cheapest... There are some pros, and cons I've now discovered.<br /><br />1. Like everyone says, the &#34;line&#34; to hook it up to a faucet is garbage, just get a bucket and heed the water marks with the amount of clothes you have in in mind.<br />2. The gravity drain is truly done by gravity. I have an electrical issue in my bathroom I learned about the hard way and had to do this in my kitchen. I prop the system up on an empty storage tote and it doesn't wiggle too much. This was after four attempts to get this thing to work. I WOULD DEFINITELY USE IT IN MY BATHTUB IF I COULD. If the drain hose is not lower than the machine it can back up and leak... which is problematic if you have it just on a floor that isn't your bathroom. Even when I get my electrical issue fixed I'll be propping it up for more efficient drainage in my tub. Even when I had it propped up on a flemsy storage tote it really didn't rock, fall, etc. It's fairly sturdy.<br />3. It will drain out just as much water as you put in, so be prepared if you're draining it in to a bucket or something. It can get heavy.<br />4. Make sure you don't have it on drain..... water just runs out every where and it's a mess..................<br />5. It REALLY does work!!!! I had some stuff that had had stains on it forever that I thought were just going to be there for good. NOPE!! Guess teh smaller loads took care of that!<br /><br /> I would give it 5 stars, but the cord being so short and the elevation necessary is a little annoying. I think once I get it in my bath tub I'll be in love because I'll be able to walk away and let it do its thing. Also, you clearly have to move it to a space, so casters would be AMAZING. It's kind of heavy to lift while there's water in it.", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AERYXBLS2SUEH2WK2XRAQWHQT6XQ", "timestamp": 1474485031000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Works for me for all the right reasons", "text": "This was not the first machine that I had tried, but the best choice for my needs after becoming more knowledgeable about the offerings available.  I live on a boat so having a pump to push water to a sink or over  the edge of a tub (though i found that the one on the first unit i tried worked well) was not an issue for me as the water drained down to the shower pump built into the shower pan floor. What was important was the rated power (watts) of the washer motor and that of the spin dryer because that's what ultimately churns out the work of agitating the clothes and spinning the water from the clothing that fit into the dryer. The washer is well rated and the dryer gets to the rated 1300 rpm effortlessly with very little initial wobble of the dryer basket and stabilizes quickly which let me know it was adequately powered as it never struggled under load. I washed everything - jeans, queen sheets, double sided curtains that cover the windows and sliding entry door - no problem either washing or spin drying. I tried this with a different, less powerful (watts) combined washer/dryer machine with lesser results and ithen wth a separate washer and a separate spin dryer setup, I had to stand and hold the dryer so it would not wobble and move across the counter. That all changed with this purchase. This one is powerful and smooth. Needless to say, I've returned  the other items and am satisfied with my purchase. Though this one is inexpensively priced, it packs a good punch and fit and finish was fine. One final observation note, there is a raised rim that borders the washer and dryer area that helps keep the water from spilling onto the floor during clothes transfer from washer to dryer. You really don't know how important that is until you own a machine that doesn't have a means of keeping the water under control when you transfer your items to the spin dryer.<br /><br />I was not paid for my opinion,  but wanted to pass along an honest assessment and what went into my selection.  If you need a machine  with a pump they are out there, but I'd also check stats and look at the supplied pictures to help my decision process. You may decide to pay more for your features,  but this was a good choice for  me.", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AGS4BGPDUHUGWRCKH27GZWX5BP4Q", "timestamp": 1465021370000, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": true}

Just like the rest of the comments, the hose to hook up to a faucet doesn\u2019t fit anything in my home, so I fill it up manually. And that isn\u2019t really a problem anyways. I do say that it really strips out the color in some clothing with possible staining on other clothes. So be sure to wash dark with only dark. Lights with only lights. So on and so forth. It\u2019s honestly not too loud, but I enjoy the sound of a washing machine anyways. Everything is pretty self explanatory when using it. This was a great investment for me, so I definitely recommend. Just always be careful washing clothes!", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61233uBrQaL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61233uBrQaL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61233uBrQaL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71NNryvuMCL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71NNryvuMCL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71NNryvuMCL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71aSBzHEMGL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71aSBzHEMGL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71aSBzHEMGL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71eT7b2WSCL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71eT7b2WSCL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71eT7b2WSCL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71n46QqP+KL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71n46QqP+KL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71n46QqP+KL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AHHQFXODNXKW6W5LS5CBVNZH767A", "timestamp": 1638860752196, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

I can fill it  up to the high mark with things like shirts,underwear and socks and it will work no prob.Really heavy items like jeans or jackets I try not to top off the machine with.A good rule of thumb if you do not see your clothes spinning in both directions the load is too heavy and you will need to split it  to assure they get cleaned well.", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AEIFWQRQPCGYQCDDCY34HEEENIAA", "timestamp": 1469807636000, "helpful_vote": 8, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great washer! Works well but needs a few accessories", "text": "This washing machine works really well once you get the hang of it. The washer has a decent capacity and the spinner leaves the clothes slightly damp. It cleans clothes thoroughly and the process maintains a great smell on the clothes if you use enough detergent for 1 load. Add a bit of fabric softener to help your clothes stay soft after drying. Be sure to rinse the clothes before and possibly during the spin cycle.<br />The instructions were in broken English and difficult to understand, so reading the reviews before using the washer was very helpful. The water intake tube does not attach securely to any faucet. I purchased a universal shower attachment for my sink that has worked wonders. It is great for filling up the washer, rinsing clothes, & cleaning the washer after.<br />The washer does not drain well unless it is raised quite a bit. You can go through the labor of lifting it up to get all of the water out, but I chose to purchase a sturdy shelf to place it on. The water drains out quickly and completely when the washer is placed on a shelf...and it also serves as a great place to store my laundry supplies.

I didn\u2019t expect this machine to work as well as it did but it sure does. The instructions are awful on the manual but there are other reviews or videos to show you how to set it up and it\u2019s quick and easy! Unfortunately i give this a 4/5 star rating only because there is a lint problem. You can\u2019t expect much but for the price it\u2019s amazing, only issue is whenever you put it in the \u201cspinner side\u201d the lint build up is CRAZY. so make sure you have a lint roller. But the spin side works in like 5 minutes and let me tell you my clothes were nearly already dry, and it\u2019s not even a legit dryer, it was just a little damp but if you hang it up it\u2019ll dry completely in about 30 minutes. But in summary this machine gets the job done, if you\u2019re thinking about buying it, BUY IT. you won\u2019t regret it.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Satisfied!!", "text": "I\u2019m actually impressed with this product! It\u2019s a LOT different than the traditional washing machine, but it suits me well. I am a minimalist living in a small house, so a small washing machine like this one is very ideal. It\u2019s also very energy efficient. Regular household washing machines are generally more electronically controlled. But compact washers, like this one, are more manually controlled.<br />My greatest con was not having a good place to drain the water out of it. But I came up with a simple solution to that. For an extra 20 dollars, I built a platform out of furring strips to put on top of the bathtub. Placing the washer directly on the bottom of the bathtub was more of a problem for 3 reasons. It wasn\u2019t quite level. The discharge hose was completely submerged during the draining process. And vibration caused the machine to slide towards the water faucets. But a simple platform took care of those issues. Plus the platform can be hung on the wall when it\u2019s not in use.<br />Another downside that I was already aware of, is that small washing machines like this one are not designed for large bulky items, like a king size bed quilt or a full body carhart suit. Those type of things either need to go to a laundromat or washed at a friends house (which is what I do occasionally).<br />As for drying clothes, traditional dryers, for the most part, are just a luxury. Unless you\u2019re in a hurry, air drying is all you really need. The onboard spinner does most of the work, but it\u2019s still makes sense to hang clothes in front of a fan or out in the sun for a more thorough drying. There were days when I hung clothes on hangers with no fan or sunlight and they STILL dried thoroughly! Natural drying just takes a little time if you\u2019re up to it.<br />I hope my review is helpful to others.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Investment Worthy", "text": "Worth every penny and to be honest...the price isn\u2019t that bad for the convenience of it. Saves money on electric and water. It actually cleans and the spin cycle works surprisingly well.

It\u2019s not quiet but not loud either. If you have paper thin walls, the noise shouldn\u2019t bother your neighbors. The drain tube, just make sure that your machine sits higher than your drain.<br /><br />Steps I take to use:<br /><br />Fill tub with water (I fill til I cover the lint vent inside) and add detergent<br />Add clothes (typically 4-5 shirts, socks and underwear) or (2-4 pants unless jeans than only 2 at a time)<br />Set length of wash cycle<br />Drain water after and refill and I set my rinse cycle for 3 minutes...I might repeat this step as well)<br />Drain again and put clothes in spin tub after. (The spin side is very small so you might have to split your load)<br />It spins very efficiently so I only spin for 1 minute.<br /><br />I also bought a small portable dryer as well. My clothes dry within 20 minutes because the water has been spun out of clothes.<br /><br />Overall, I will definitely recommend and I plan on buying a second one. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AF4RPU7JNQGKXREYSZ7HLFV7UYBQ", "timestamp": 1615952546649, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

So unless you have a floor drain or can drain it to the outside, your out of luck. I had to lift the unit onto my bathroom counter to get it to drain into the sink.

You can definitely hear it especially the spin tub but honestly I liked that I could hear it. That way I could know the cycle was done from another room. The spin tub obviously isn\u2019t supposed to fully dry your clothes (you\u2019ll need a drying rack for that) but it gets pretty darn close especially on the smallest loads. When you take the spun clothes out however, sometimes theres a lot of lint stuck to them so you might want to get a lint roller if you don\u2019t already have one. What I disliked the most however was the lint build up because the built in filter doesn\u2019t really do anything. If you\u2019re emptying down a drain you will most definitely need a hair catcher because it will clog. but in the end it never stopped working until I sold it and I ran it about 8 times a week for a year.

Another thing is that the clothes do tangle mostly in the regular mode not as much in soft mode so be careful with delicate clothing that is easily miss shaped with a pull & a tug. I did have a problem with the machine one month into using it.. It lost all power.. After dissecting it I found it was a simple fuse! I was so excited because I love using this machine and for $100 dollars I got enough loads of laundry in to pay itself off so I wasn't bummed about the money spent just that I wanted to continue to use it! Finding that size fuse was a chore... After checking all stores I finally found the fuse at Frys electronics.. Don't think twice! Worth the money and time saved going to the laundry mat! Oh and be careful not to use too much soap & softner you just need a tad.. And don't under estimate this machine I find it can handle a good size load both in washer and spinner!

I have had the machine for just a week now but so far I love it and everything about it. It does require more work than a fully automatic machine but if you live in an apt with no hookups like I do and are tired of wasting $40-50 dollars a month at the laundry machines you will gladly exchange the extra work for the hassle of spending unnecessary money and using machines other people have had their dirty clothes in. Plus no more walking all the way to the laundry room for me. I had reconstructive knee surgery a few months back and walking long distances is hard and sometimes painful. So this is how I use it. We put our clothes in the machine instead of a hamper. When it gets almost full I take the clothes out and move it into my bathtub. I use my detachable shower head to fill the machine. There are two fill lines, one about halfway up the lint filter and another near the top of the machine. Then I add detergent and switch it on for it to mix. Then add clothes and run it on soft unless I have towels. Normal will tangle your clothes! Then drain and spin them for about one minute. Then I repeat the process to rinse but spin for longer to get the water out. The lint filter is excellent, I have no idea why I keep reading it's useless. I have to empty and rinse it after almost every load. The capacity is awesome. I washed 15 adult size small and medium t-shirts at once with no problems. If you have heavy items like towels or jeans though you can only wash one or two along with your load. Otherwise the weight prevents the clothes from spinning in the wash tub properly. But you can wash a pair of jeans with plenty of light items with no problem. So there are very few cons to this machine, and solutions to all of them.

Put it in the bathtub and plug it in with an extension cord (I know that's technically not allowed but I tried carrying it there to drain after it was full which was a nightmare)<br />2.Set to normal or soft (accidentally had it on drain for a little while when I was adding water whoops)<br />3. Add liquid detergent (whatever looks good I now do enough to see bubbles in the water)<br />4. Add items to be washed (I started with filling only halfway but I now do up to 3/4 of the way because they compress when wet, also one or a couple at a time is a good idea.)<br />5. Fill with 12qt pot (my largest loads need 6 full pots worth you can also use a bucket just cover the items)<br />6. Turn the nob to 15 (minutes)<br />7. When the load is finished (no noise it just stops) unhook the large plastic tube from the side<br />8. Turn nob to drain<br />9. Place items in spinner basket in a spiral (this helps them more easily orient that way when it spins super fast and prevents it from clanking around and giving you a momentary heart attack)<br />10. Pour a bit of clean water in to rinse the items and set spin (right-hand nob) to 2 (minutes)<br />11. Pour a bit more clean water in for a final rinse and then set spin to 5 (minutes)<br />12.

Then set it to drain, it drains into the tub, take clothes out and put in spinner for a minute or two to get suds out ,still while set to drain so water spins out (spin side is small so separate into 2 or 3 sessions), set back to normal and fill with clean cold water and no soap, put clothes back in and set timer again, this is like a rinse cycle, then drain and spin again and hang to dry.<br />It's a few steps, I know, it's hands on more than set and forget, but this machine works fantastic.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "A few things to note (and suggestions)", "text": "I love this washer, and it\u2019s still going strong a year later! (Although the washer I got is definitely by Costway, so not sure why it is sold as Giantex?) You definitely won\u2019t be wanting to wash anything heavy duty like big blankets in here, as you won\u2019t be able to fit it into the spin dryer to wring the water out. The spin dryer WILL smell a little funky after about 3 spin drying cycles (almost fishy?), but it\u2019s really just that it needs some time to \u201crest\u201d and cool off. It is not malfunctioning, it is just the way it is. I try not to do more than 5-6 spin drying cycles in a row, although if it takes 3 to do a small load of clothes (and none of these loads should ever be big) then by the time I wash the next load, the dryer will have had some time to rest before I do another 3 cycles. I don\u2019t usually wash more than 2 loads in a row though, so that comes out to 5-6 spin drying cycles close together. It\u2019s a learning curve.<br /><br />We put this in the shower and stand it on top of a set of bed risers to help the water drain down through the plastic tube (which is kind of gross looking inside after a year, but I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything I can realistically do about that). We have a removable shower head, so we just prop it in there to fill when we need to.<br /><br />Most people have already said what needs to be said about this washer, so I\u2019ll only add a few things.<br /><br />Two small negative things I want to note are that the spin dryer plastic lid insert...thing...(you see it in the photos), a) doesn\u2019t serve a purpose as far as I can tell, b) if not inserted at the top correctly, it makes a really loud noise clacking around in there, and c) finally got sucked into the spin dryer bin at one point and got itself chewed up in the process being spun around at such a rapid speed. But, like I said anyway, it didn\u2019t seem to provide a real benefit, so I wasn\u2019t too torn up about it.<br /><br />The other small negative, was that at one point, we did not insert our lint catcher into its slot securely, and it got whacked around the washer during the cycle and the plastic of the catcher cracked. So it no longer fits into the slot. Now, this is entirely our fault, but I tried emailing the company asking if I could at least pay to purchase a replacement for the lint catcher. They wrote back saying that my washer was past its 6 month warranty, and the best they could do was provide $20 compensation for me to get my washer repaired locally. But who is going to repair a plastic lint catcher insert? (For the record, I did try super glue.) I wrote back explaining that I didn\u2019t need a refund, and it was not the washer that needed to be repaired, I just needed a new lint catcher and would be happy to pay for it. Their response to that second email was, and I quote, \u201cThanks for your reply. Have a nice day!\u201c So I wasn\u2019t really impressed with their customer service team.<br /><br />My solution ended up being buying a pack of those foam flower lint catchers (those cheap ones that have really bad reviews? Yes!) because they actually worked pretty well for catching lint and fur in these types of washers! I think they\u2019re usually rated so badly because people try to put them in commercial washers, not these Asian portable ones. I usually just throw one in on top and it has more than made up for the broken lint catcher I can no longer use. Those flower lint catchers may catch even more than the one the washer originally had.<br /><br />I would also recommend (if you\u2019re draining this down the tub or something) to purchase a set of lint snares/traps so that you don\u2019t clog anything up. I don\u2019t think I can directly link to other products in reviews, but the exact item name of what I purchased is \u201c Lot of 50 Washing Machine Lint Trap Snare Fabric mesh with ties,\u201d which are plastic mesh catchers that I put over the end of the tube with some finagling with a zip tie. I would suggest inserting one trap into another just to ensure the mesh is fine enough, and with the amount of pet hair and lint we have, I wind up throwing the inner trap out every 2-3 weeks (when the water starts having to squirt out of the trap instead of simply draining). Not very eco-friendly, and I feel guilty about it every time I do it, but you can\u2019t really scrape the lint out of long skinny tubes like that.<br /><br />So anyway! The washer itself is great, just be aware of potential minor issues (and how to deal with them). That\u2019s all I got.", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AEV7GSNZBFKLBNHPDCP2FFATLHGQ", "timestamp": 1600062795402, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": true}

This little machine has saved me about $30 per week, that's $120 per mth. I can wash sheets, towels, jeans, etc.  I only go to the laundry mat to do my heavy duty washing now and I only go to the laundry every 2 - 3 wks to dry my sheets, towels, etc.  Otherwise,  I wash my child's uniforms and everything else using this little 'miracle'.  As with every purchase, there are pros and cons.  You just have to make sure you have the machine placed on a higher surface level than where it will be draining.  I got some wood pallets from Home Depot and let the water drain in my bath tub...problem solved.  I have one of those extender hose on my shower head to make filling up the machine faster (no lifting).  I can spend $20 drying my clothes at the laundry mat, as needed for over a 2 mth period.  The smaller items of clothing dry in a few hours after spinning.....and the machine washes clean!", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AFJYG6WJYW3MLG3T6UK2GT4QE7AQ", "timestamp": 1522002368126, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

If you are a DIY kind of guy like I am, I recommend cutting a PVC pipe to fit over the center of the star-shape agitator at the bottom of the wash tub and securing that in place.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "It's okay", "text": "Is an okay machine. Definitely noisy. Im a girl and while it was a little difficult to move, i could move it. Kept it in my camper bathtub so it could just drain and wouldn't take up what little space i had, and took it out each time I had to shower. Plastic fill tube wouldn't fit my faucet either, just used my showerhead. Used it outside a few times and filled with a bucket but that was fairly inconvenient. I wish the filter was closer to the bottom of the machine, i don't like that's its near the top. If you do plan on draining this into a tub, especially a  camper tub, i recommend getting a filter for the drain. I don't think the one for this machine took out much, and i noticed a fair amount of tiny fibers in the water, all of which were ending up down my drain. My machine lasted about a year. I did a load of laundry in the morning and left afterwards, forgetting to unplug it. Im not sure what happened, but when i came home it smelled like burnt plastic, and the back of the machine was very hot. After that you could hear it turn on, but the wash drum wouldnt spin. I'm worried that if i had not come back when i did there could have been a fire. It was also 119.99 when I bought it, and theyre now selling it for 189 which is a bit steep to me. Washing clothes is very hands on since each load only takes 10 minutes to wash, then 5 minutes for the spin dry (but do this twice since spin drum is half the size of wash drum) and finally to hang up the clothes.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Honest review!", "text": "This is just my honest opinion. I\u2019m only leaving a review because I rely on reviews before buying items on Amazon. So, I\u2019m just trying to help out the next person who can relate.<br /><br />This item came in pretty dirty on the inside, which I thought was weird but soap and water fixed that. I live in apartments and it\u2019s pretty loud, so I try not to use it too early or too late in the day. This is my second time using it - I had a regular size hamper full of clothes along with three full bed sized sheets I needed to wash. I started around 8am and ended around 2ish pm. (I was washing dishes, cleaning my apartment and working on hw in between). Very portable, and not heavy. I was able to lift it onto my kitchen counter (for the elevation) and I just stand on my kitchen chair while I\u2019m using it. To get the water in, I just used buckets for now. The hose it came with is too small for my sink. I\u2019m waiting for my detachable shower head to come in so I can just input the water from there and drain the water in my tub.<br /><br />Washing:<br />For my clothes, if it\u2019s heavy like work pants or jackets, I put only about 3-5 items and it worked well. For regular items like socks and underwear or light shorts and shirts, I was able to fit it about 8-10 items. Really depends on your clothes. But just know the spinner side will only fit half of what you washed. Example: I put 4 work pants to wash, but when I put them in the spin side, one two fit.<br />For my bed sheets, two were super thin and I was able to wash both together but had to spin them separately. I washed a bedsheet that was thicker and had to wash and spin it on its own.<br /><br />Spinner: it\u2019s true what they say. It won\u2019t dry your clothes completely but it depends on the material. Some of my clothing came out dry and some didn\u2019t. Whatever didn\u2019t, I just hung up and opened the windows and by the end of the night - everything was dry.<br /><br />Overall, I love how this machine washed everything. On the first drain, the water was gross but after the second drain, the water came out nice and clean. The spinner does it\u2019s job and spins most of the water out of your soaking wet clothes to 85% dry.<br /><br />Steps I used:<br />I wash my clothes on \u201cnormal\u201d with detergent first (left side) for about 12 min, drain the water, then throw my clothes in the spinner (right side) for about 2 min, then throw clothes back to (left side), put the cycle to \u201cnormal\u201d to wash with fabric softener for about 12 min, drain water, then back to the spin side for about 5 minutes to finish off.<br /><br />Tips:<br />1. Use only a little bit of detergent and fabric softener.<br />2. Don\u2019t over do it. It\u2019s a small machine so it\u2019s obvious that only a certain amount of items will fit.<br />3. Clean out your filter after you are done using the washer side (left side)<br />4. Wipe the inside of your machine down (on the spinner side there will be hair, lint from clothing and whatnot), and keep the lids up and open so it can dry out.<br /><br />One thing I didn\u2019t like at all - there\u2019s a weird smell that comes from the machine while you use it, it made me a bit dizzy and nauseous. I\u2019ll update this review after I\u2019ve done a couple more washes to see if the problem continues.<br /><br />I hope this review is helpful!", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AFLO7LHM73B5D4KQM37SPCN6Q4LA", "timestamp": 1651632687894, "helpful_vote": 8, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "The right product at the right price!", "text": "This washer has been great for the money spent! I am able to do a couple pairs of jeans/pants with shirts and smaller items so I would honestly say about a half of a normal sized washer load. Maybe even 3/4's depending on items. I was able to do sheets in this too, however comforters seem unrealistic so therefor have not tried it nor would I recommend. With this washer I would say that I can keep up with normal laundry for two adults once a week and be fine. The spinner is also fantastic, the clothes come out almost fully dried and only take about 4-8 hours to dry fully (12 hours for thicker items/denim/jeans). The negatives of this product is of course that it has no pump so it does require a setup to which you can drain all the water from it, and with that, I personally use buckets to fill it as the house it comes with is difficult to setup to the sink I have to use for it, however I know that with other reviews and usage from other people that it can work with some life-hacking. The only other con I would say is the slight grease smell that remains for several uses, not bad nor does it leech into the clothing but the room it would be in will have a faint smell of it for some time. With all that being out there I would say that for the money you are spending and if in a situation where you would like to have normal options for washing clothes in an apartment or smaller space this is top of its game and would highly recommend.", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AFMDQA2SB3KBXJS6KQQADG33O5LQ", "timestamp": 1497020093000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

One of the box corners was a little smushed but the way it\u2019s packaged protected it just fine. I\u2019ve had it for almost 2 months now and so far so good. I just set it in my bathtub (use my handheld shower attachment to fill it) on a cushioned mat and have a long extension cord that I run over the shower curtain rod to keep it well out of reach of water. It feels a lot sturdier in person than what the pictures portray. The spinner side does an awesome job at getting as much water out of the clothes as possible. Depending on the item itself some stuff is dry within an hour. I\u2019d highly recommend that you use a detergent that doesn\u2019t make a ton of suds, just makes it easier to get the clothes rinsed better. It\u2019s definitely something that you need to be around to keep the load going. Cause once it\u2019s done the wash or rinse cycle, you have to drain the water to get to the next step. Some people just drain it and then fill it with rinse water and cycle again for the rinse. I actually spin the clothes for a couple of minutes to extract as much of the soapy water as I can before I do the rinse cycle and that\u2019s really helped. The main thing is that you want to make sure you have someplace to dry your freshly laundered clothes. I got in laundry mode, did too much that first day. I had to improvise for drying spots cause I don\u2019t always like to use hangers since the items can wind up getting those funny shoulder bumps. Walmart sells a cheap drying rack for $9 that you just angle in at its folding point and then can lean against a wall. You don\u2019t have to worry about them dripping cause there isn\u2019t enough water left after the full 5 minute spin to drip off. The only other thing is to remember to turn the dial back to the normal setting before you start filling it again cause otherwise while it\u2019s filling on one side it\u2019s draining out the tube on the other. Also- if the drainage tube is coming out of the opposite side that you need it to, it\u2019s designed to snap out and come out the other. Easy peasy, just turn it on its side and you\u2019ll see. It\u2019s not a real washer and dryer but when you don\u2019t have hook-ups for those it\u2019s absolutely worth the purchase!", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AE42FAXZJUFRKVPRP3XQATVDS6GQ", "timestamp": 1646276578057, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

I've been living in a small 500 sq. ft. apt for over a year and the laundry is at the front of the complex, which was enough for me to procrastinate doing my laundry on a regular basis.  Now, all I have to do is pull this little monster out and all my problems have been solved.  It's not heavy and because it is compact, it's not a nuisance in my small space.  It's not noisy and it has some power!  I'm on a laundry spree as we speak and this little guy has been worth it's weight in gold.  Don't even hesitate purchasing one of these.  It's easy to use and is phenomenal.<br />Now, the instructions are very very very tiny and in a bit of broken English, so I would recommend watching one of the videos posted just to see how it works before you try it for the first time.  But honestly, it's so easy.  I use it in my tub so I can fill and drain it rather easily and when it spins the clothing in the spin tub, they come out so close to dry it's shocking.<br />I can't say enough about this washer.  Please, don't even think twice.  It's a great machine and well worth the money!<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I felt like I needed to come back and update my review because I purchased this washer in Dec. of 2018 and I'm using right now and have without any issues.  It is still going strong, and is just the best tiny washer one could ask for.  It does get this low hum when the washer is running as it turns but it's not a deal breaker.  I also run it in my tub, so it could be louder because of the closed in area it's working in.  I did break down and purchase a small electric dryer just to finish the clothing and fluff them up so they aren't so stiff.

You are better off watching a quick video tutorial online.<br /><br />I Placed it in my bathroom tub and put 4 spunges under each leg to cushion/minimize any rattling. Filled it using my corded shower head (the tube it comes with is garage). And tossed a set of clothes into it. I found that a shot glass full of liquid laundry detergent is the perfect amount for this size of machine. I run it twice at 6min to flush out all the soap (wash/rinse cycles).<br />The spin dryer is amazing. It is terrifying when it starts up because the clothes in it cause the machine to shake violently but after a few second the weight is distributed better and it stops shaking (until it slows down/stops at the end). The water is about 90% rung out at the end of this.<br /><br />I've done a few loads of wash with this and I am pleased with it.

After the first month it had suddenly stopped working. When I opened it up to see what was wrong I discovered unsecured wireing had been laying on the belt and the belt had eaten through them. I bought industeral grade wire desgined for underwater use and a $50 rewiring job later she runs like a dream. Also made to zip tie the new cable out of the way of the belt. The current struggle is with the centrifuge for the spin dry. First the steel cable had streched meaning the break was still engaged when it was trying to spin. If Ihad caught the problem faster I only would have had to change the position of a hook. Unfortunately I didn't catch it in time and the brake twisted. To make matters worse this thing uses a piece of cork for a brake pad which had worn to almost nothing. Still trying to figure out what I can use to replace the pad. A bike break pad won't work because this break is curved inwards. It took a few days to twist the metal back into place and it's sort of spinning like it should. I suspect too much strain was put on the centrifuge motor when the brake let go. Currently it takes it about 2 minutes to get up to speed to ring out any water. As it stands I probably have six months before the motor completely goes. Even with the rewiring job I've already saved more money doing laundry this way then I would have taking it to the laundromat.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Better than the laundry mat", "text": "Although overall it does ok, there are several things I was not aware of when I purchased this. I had to do a lot of research to figure things out.<br />First the intake hose is a joke if you live in an apartment or where there are regular nozzles. I guess it\u2019s for a camper. I ended up purchasing a pet shower sprayer (you attach it to your shower head- it was fairly easy because my shower head wasn\u2019t hard to get off- but some may be on tight and you\u2019ll have to loosen it with a wrench(?))and filling it up that way. It cleans pretty good and it takes only about 15 minutes. However, it does not rinse, you have to drain it and refill it and do the wash again(at least that\u2019s what I do).<br />I put mine in the bath tub on top of the styrofoam that it was packed in.<br />The drain hose is very small as well but I believe there are extensions for that.<br />The \u2018dryer\u2019 is just like the spin cycle on a washing machine. It does not dry your clothes. It just spins out excess water.<br />I washed 3 pair of women\u2019s jeans and 2 tops (it can hold a little more but I wanted to be sure they would get clean). The spin part is very small so you can\u2019t put the whole load in the spin part. I put 2pair of jeans in and it spun them out ok. I tried to spin several times but it didn\u2019t seem to make a difference, once all the excess water is spun out. I use a clothes dryer rack to hang them on. It takes at least over night to get dry.<br />I chose this one because the more expensive ones (which have more features) seamed more complicated to hook up. You had to hook them under the sink (to hot and cold pipes) and unhook when done. I\u2019m older so that was an issue for me.<br />I also purchased casters but it\u2019s not heavy when empty. It\u2019s just easier to maneuver.", "images": [], "asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "parent_asin": "B01ALBMIEI", "user_id": "AHVO2MDM7CGZGUKH65WBS2HUFVVA", "timestamp": 1539185987991, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

I always leave 15+15 and wash for 30 minutes. After that, I drain the water with detergent (then you need to switch to the Drain function) and fill it again and drain the water for 5 minutes. Finally, I put it in the dryer for 5 minutes. It dries very well. The price is very reasonable. Washes clothes very clean. Very good in capacity. It is possible to wash many clothes at once. It does not make a lot of noise, just like normal washing machines.
